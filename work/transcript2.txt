0:15
hey guys welcome to capturing
0:17
christianity i am cameron bertuzzi and i
0:19
am here today with dr sai gart welcome
0:21
to the show i mean you've been on the
0:23
channel before but i have yeah so here
0:25
you're today with us in person and i'm
0:27
so excited to meet you wish i could see
0:29
your wife but i'm sure that she's here
0:31
she's here in spirit isn't she i miss
0:34
her too yeah yeah well so today we're
0:36
talking about your journey from atheism
0:39
all the way to christianity right and
0:41
there's a whole lot that's happened in
0:42
between you know back when you were an
0:45
atheist and now that you're a christian
0:46
we'll talk about all the steps that kind
0:48
of led there some of the science that
0:50
that because you your background is in
0:52
what is it micro not microsoft
0:54
biochemistry and so your your yeah your
0:56
background as a scientist
0:58
but that's actually what led you
1:00
to
1:01
embrace god's existence and then
1:03
eventually to to become a christian
1:05
right so how let's start at the the very
1:07
beginning tell me about your upbringing
1:09
i know we've talked about this on the
1:10
channel before but let's uh kind of go
1:12
through it a little bit more in some
1:14
more detail sure well yeah i won't go
Growing up an atheist
1:17
into too much because as you said we we
1:18
have covered it and
1:20
it's uh it's in my book so you know
1:22
people can find it
1:23
uh but i i grew up in a basically uh in
1:27
a family three generations of atheists
1:30
uh they were not only atheists they were
1:32
very left-wing my parents were members
1:34
of the american communist party in the
1:36
1930s which is rare
1:39
and so uh
1:41
their atheism was very strong very
1:43
militant
1:45
and that's what i grew up with i i uh
1:48
assumed that there was could not be any
1:51
such thing as god or not possible for
1:53
them to be a god
1:55
totally materialistic my father was a
1:57
chemist scientist so you know i
2:00
that was the world view i grew up in
2:03
uh
2:04
and and also the same world view i had
2:06
when i went to college where i started
2:08
studying chemistry
2:10
chip off the old block and um
2:13
you know when you're a chemistry major
2:15
you also have to learn some physics so i
2:17
was learning things about quantum
2:18
mechanics and things in physics that
2:21
seemed a little strange to me but i
2:23
didn't really worry about it too much
2:24
and then eventually i decided i really
2:26
wanted to study life
2:29
and
2:29
rather than be a biologist i wanted to
2:31
study the chemistry of life so i went
2:33
into biochemistry where i got my phd
2:36
uh and
2:38
what happened was that
2:40
even even in college as a young man i
2:43
began to feel there was something
2:45
missing in my life so and i later
2:47
realized it was some sense of
2:49
spirituality
2:50
which i think is very important for all
2:52
people
2:53
but i found that whatever that you want
2:56
to call that in science at first i was
2:58
thinking
2:59
well you know the science is great
3:01
because it gives you a real sense of
3:02
purpose a real sense of
3:05
doing something good in the world and
3:07
it's true you know so it's great
3:10
but there was one catch which was that
3:13
what i was learning in science didn't
3:16
jive with the materialistic world view
3:18
and i i couldn't have said it that way i
3:20
just
3:21
i just felt it
3:23
for example uh
3:25
in graduate school i learned about the
3:27
process by which proteins are made in
3:29
cells and that's a very complex process
3:32
that
3:34
involves
3:35
a tremendous amount of
3:36
uh
3:38
biomolecules interacting with each other
3:41
and the complexity is just incredible
3:43
and i remember
3:45
feeling like a chill going down my spine
3:47
i it was like
3:48
this is amazing
3:51
where did how did this get here and it
3:53
was something that i couldn't answer
3:56
uh
3:58
later of course like most biologists i
4:02
just came up with the answer which is
4:04
evolution evolution does everything
4:09
but
4:10
when i
4:11
at that time i kind of left things as it
4:13
was and as they were and i just
4:20
started wondering about really
4:23
whether science was really the only way
4:25
to find any truth and i pretty soon i
4:28
rejected that as many people have
4:31
i was not yet ready to believe in god
4:34
and that took a lot of other steps it
4:36
required
4:38
it required me to
4:40
kind of break down my resistance to the
4:42
idea which was which i was born with and
4:45
it's it's kind of hard to you know
4:47
reject all of that but eventually i did
4:50
and then uh were there any external
4:52
factors that were helping to open you up
4:55
yes to god absolutely uh
4:58
i was brought to a church by a friend
5:01
and this was still when you were an
5:02
atheist oh yeah and i was well maybe by
5:05
then i was a little agnostic i wasn't
5:07
really sure
5:09
so you got to the point of agnostic yeah
5:11
all on your own
5:12
that was all on my own and that was due
5:14
to the science i was learning because
5:16
the science i was learning did not
5:17
support a strict atheism it did not
5:20
support strict materialism okay
5:22
and and that comes from quantum theory
5:24
and it comes from you know the observer
5:26
effect and all sorts of things in
5:27
physics but it also came from what i was
5:30
learning in biochemistry and about how
5:32
life works right it just seemed
5:35
that saying evolution explains
5:37
everything in life was to glib
5:39
you know it was too easy it didn't seem
5:42
to me to be enough that's interesting
God is a lazy explanation
5:44
because i've heard a lot of scientists
5:46
even like peter atkins will say that god
5:48
is like a lazy explanation
5:50
and you're saying that evolution is kind
5:52
of like a lazy explanation well uh you
5:54
know
5:56
at that time i would have said god was a
5:58
lazy explanation too i had no idea what
6:00
the explanation was i didn't really know
6:03
what god was i didn't understand very
6:05
much about god
6:07
but yeah uh i think i think evolution
6:10
can explain a lot
6:13
but there are some key things that it
6:15
cannot explain and that includes the
6:17
origin of life and that's not my view
6:19
that's a very
6:21
darwin said the same thing richard
6:22
dawkins has said the same thing yeah the
6:24
the process of evolution that we call
6:27
darwinian evolution of biological
6:28
evolution
6:30
um
6:31
doesn't deal with the origin of life at
6:33
all
6:34
so
6:35
and i'll get into that a little more i
6:37
think uh but
6:39
the external factors that helped me were
6:41
as i said
6:42
going to a church for the first time and
6:45
seeing something that i
6:46
absolutely didn't expect i thought that
6:48
when you walked into a church the first
6:50
thing that would happen is
6:51
the priest or the pastor would start
6:53
yelling at you you know telling you that
6:55
you're sinful and you know you're going
6:56
to go to hell where did you get that an
6:58
impression from well that's the
7:00
impression i got growing up you know
7:01
that from who though who who did well i
7:04
mean maybe it's a different time but it
7:06
was it was a different time but it was
7:07
also
7:08
it was also
7:10
by the way it's not over yet i mean
7:11
there you still find atheists talking
7:13
about you know
7:14
uh the horrors of christianity and how
7:17
they
7:18
and how you know people are doing
7:20
nothing but casting you into hell all
7:22
the time and
7:24
lakes of fire and sin and
7:26
and i felt you know very nervous and
7:30
it was and your experience was nothing
7:32
like that no it was a catholic church
7:34
run by uh franciscans
7:37
and uh
7:39
the priest
7:40
gave a sermon about love
7:43
love period not you know love god but
7:46
just love each other love
7:49
and i thought boy this is very mild
7:52
you know
7:53
why you know
7:55
i think i've been lied to
7:59
so at that point i looked into this a
8:01
little more
8:03
i wasn't the theist yet but i started
8:05
looking at the bible for the first time
8:09
the old testament left me a little cold
8:11
i just couldn't really get into it
8:12
didn't understand it much
8:15
but i read the book of matthew and i
8:17
read the book of acts and
8:20
i found those
8:22
very moving
8:24
a book of acts struck me as actual
8:27
history i didn't have any i was sure
8:30
that this was not something anyone made
8:31
up it just didn't fit
8:34
so that got me thinking and and then i
8:36
you know i learn more and more and as i
8:38
talk about in my book i'm not going to
8:39
go into detail now i had
8:41
several experiences including some
8:43
dreams and a waking experience that
8:46
i had to attribute to the holy spirit
8:48
and at that point i after many years by
8:51
the way i'm talking i'm compressing two
8:53
decades
8:54
into this discussion
8:56
but at that point i realized that
8:59
christianity is true and christ was real
9:03
and
9:04
he lived and died and rose
9:07
and i became a christian yeah
9:09
i want to focus in on one part of your
9:11
story but i also want to make a kind of
9:13
general comment about
9:15
the so sometimes i see atheists say like
9:17
okay now it's just like this one that
9:19
that is the reason why he became a
9:20
christian and that usually they pinpoint
9:22
some like bad thing that happened or
9:24
you know this this is a bad reason to
9:26
become a christian but in your case and
9:28
i think in a lot of cases probably the
9:30
vast majority of cases that it's a
9:32
multiplicity of different things
9:34
that all together you know built up and
9:36
built up over many years you said you're
9:38
compressing in a story in you know five
9:41
minutes something that happened to you
9:42
over the course of 20 years right and so
9:45
obviously you're leaving things out and
9:47
you can't actually get the sense of like
9:49
all of these things building up and
9:51
leading to this huge paradigm shift in
9:53
your thinking and your worldview yeah
9:55
but that that's just the point that i
9:56
wanted to make is that there's a whole
9:58
lot of things going on oh yeah in your
10:00
story yeah and they all work together
10:02
like it started out you know from
10:04
atheism to agnosticism based purely on
10:07
the science and then you had these other
10:09
experiences and everything kind of
10:10
played together to lead you to christ so
Biogenesis
10:13
that's one point i want to make and then
10:15
the second point was to bring us back to
10:18
uh focus on one area that really got you
10:21
considering leaving atheism right and i
10:23
understand is it a biogenesis that's a
10:25
biogenesis that's one of the main things
10:28
so tell me more about that how did that
10:30
looking into that really
10:32
bringing more toward christianity toward
10:35
theism
10:36
well
10:37
you know it's interesting because
10:39
abiogenesis is very active field of
10:41
research and people are looking at it
10:44
uh very intensely in various ways i've
10:47
done a little bit myself
10:49
but uh have you published yes i have
10:52
okay one paper published and one that's
10:55
just about to be approved both on the
10:58
same subject which is
11:00
i wish i'll get to in a second but
11:03
as i mentioned abiogenesis
11:06
nobody thinks that it has anything to do
11:08
with you know standard evolution
11:11
the the general idea among scientists
11:14
anyway and and the atheist ideas that
11:16
we're not scientists are not worth
11:17
discussing but
11:19
the general scientific idea is that
11:22
life began
11:24
through what's called chemical
11:26
evolution and chemical evolution is very
11:29
different from biological evolution
11:30
because there's no natural selection
11:34
and there's no replication or you see
11:37
there's no mutations
11:39
yeah
11:40
what chemical chemical evolution is when
11:43
you take chemicals
11:45
you put them together and they either
11:47
react or they
11:49
somehow are able to
11:52
do things only on the basis of chemistry
11:55
without any
11:58
mutation without any replication and
12:00
without any natural selection
12:03
and that's pretty hard to do uh
12:07
jim tour who's in this neighborhood
12:10
uh
12:11
has often said uh
12:14
quite strongly and correctly
12:16
that people who say that we're almost
12:19
we've solved so many problems in a
12:20
biogenesis we're almost there are just
12:22
wrong he says a little more strongly
12:27
i was listening to something with him
12:29
the other day but he's correct so
12:31
he's forceful yeah he's forceful and but
12:34
he's right and i know why he's
12:36
he he gets frustrated sometimes because
12:38
he is a chemist a very good chemist and
12:41
he knows more than anyone
12:43
that that's not how chemistry works
12:45
chemistry
12:46
you know
12:47
doesn't do things
12:49
for any reason by life does things
12:51
because of natural selection perhaps or
12:53
because of
12:54
you know the way life works
12:57
and you can get evolution but you can't
12:59
get it started
13:00
and i started thinking about this years
13:03
ago
13:04
uh especially
13:07
related to
13:08
one of my interests which is you know
13:11
how
13:12
how the dna works by coding the
13:15
existence of proteins which cause life
13:18
and
13:19
you know uh stephen meyer has written
13:21
about this and signature of the cell and
13:23
he has in his recent book the return of
13:25
the god hypothesis he talks a little bit
13:27
about it as well
13:30
but i was focusing on one specific
13:33
aspect which is
13:35
critical to the origin of life
13:37
to the origin of evolution
13:40
and that is the accuracy of
13:42
self-replication because nothing in the
13:45
universe self-replicates accurately
13:47
other than living cells
13:49
no chemical self-replicates
13:51
no machine self-replicates
13:53
crystals don't self-replicate
13:56
even dna doesn't self-replicate but a
13:58
living cell can self can make copies of
14:02
itself that are 99.9999
14:05
accurate
14:07
that's astonishing
14:09
how does that happen
14:10
it involves a tremendous number of
14:12
really complex things including the
14:14
genetic code including
14:17
ribosomes and dna
14:19
dna replication and protein synthesis
14:22
things that are just too complicated to
14:23
describe without slides
14:26
or without a semester of without a
14:29
semester of biology yeah or chemistry or
14:32
whatever
14:33
so
14:35
if you if you
14:37
if you have to have self-replication in
14:39
order to have evolution how how do you
14:41
get how do you get all this how did that
14:43
self-replication
14:45
get there yeah
14:46
it couldn't have evolved
14:48
because there's no evolution
14:51
and that's what i've been studying and
14:53
what i published on recently uh the fact
14:56
that in fact as i assumed
14:59
uh using various models or i'm not going
15:01
to get into
15:03
that
15:04
there are thresholds
15:06
and if you don't start out with a cell
15:09
that already is pretty good at accurate
15:12
self-replication
15:14
you can't do it
15:16
you'll never get living cells and you'll
15:18
never get evolution going
15:21
and as i say that's been published in a
15:23
theoretical journal okay
Current Science
15:25
so
15:26
you've got to get the self first in
15:28
order to get it up and going together
15:30
and get any evolution but then to get to
15:32
that point to get to the first cell you
15:34
need just too many things is that kind
15:36
of the idea yeah you need you need too
15:38
many things that are too difficult
15:41
to explain through only chemical
15:43
evolution
15:45
so what what is the current like science
15:48
scienti uh consensus is that what's the
15:51
current scientific consensus about a
15:52
biogenesis it depends who you talk to if
15:55
you talk to people who are not working
15:56
in the field many of them will say oh
15:58
yeah we're getting there we've got a lot
16:00
made a lot of progress we know that
16:02
amino acids you know were in meteors so
16:04
they probably you know developed
16:07
or formed in the primeval earth
16:09
we know that uh nucleotides can make
16:12
long polymers with rna
16:15
that
16:15
yeah that's all true but the people who
16:17
are actually the leaders in these fields
16:19
in this field
16:21
uh know the details and the details are
16:23
exactly what jim tour says it doesn't
16:25
happen you don't get long polymers you
16:28
get short polymers you don't get
16:30
self-replication you get annealing you
16:32
get junk rather than good stuff
16:37
that's what they know and frankly uh i
16:40
think many of them are getting
16:41
discouraged
16:43
it looks like not a lot of progress has
16:46
been made
16:47
in fact very little
16:49
and the numbers of problems just keep
16:50
expanding
16:52
so uh
The Alternative
16:53
so the the
16:55
alternative that you arrived at was what
16:58
well so i don't know i didn't know uh
17:00
what i what i
17:02
i thought there was there's something
17:04
missing and
17:06
this was the how this affected my
17:09
journey to faith was that it it broke
17:12
and helped break down this absolute
17:15
certainty that everything is explainable
17:17
by materialistic science okay
17:20
but i didn't know what the answer was
17:21
right
17:23
once i became a believer
17:25
and i started thinking well
17:27
god is the creator of the universe but i
17:30
also
17:31
said
17:32
not just the universe he's also the
17:34
creator of life and the creator of human
17:36
beings all of which
17:38
are not explainable by any other means
17:41
so
17:43
but how see that's my question because
17:46
knowing that god did something to me is
17:48
not enough
17:50
i want to know a little more details
17:52
[Laughter]
17:54
i don't know if i can i don't know if
17:55
anyone can ever
17:56
learn that or understand that because we
17:58
don't know how god works you know
18:01
obviously
18:02
but i want to keep looking at it and i
18:04
want to keep you know investigating
18:07
various hypotheses i don't think we
18:08
should stop doing scientific research on
18:11
the issue
18:12
but i think we need to be open
18:14
and
18:15
it may be
18:17
that biology is at the same place that
18:19
physics was before einstein came up with
18:21
relativity
18:22
they were kind of stuck
18:24
they had solved everything except this
18:26
nasty thing called light which nobody
18:28
could understand
18:30
and when einstein solved light through
18:32
relativity
18:34
it changed physics forever and it
18:37
it turned out physics was nowhere near
18:39
complete
18:40
and now we're in a position where you
18:42
know we have a huge amount of more
18:44
knowledge which makes the physical
18:46
picture of the universe totally
18:48
different than we originally thought
18:50
and i think biology is in exactly the
18:52
same place right now we need to expand
18:56
our tools
18:57
we need to include new concepts into our
19:01
studies of biology
19:03
and i'm not only the only one saying
19:05
this there are even some non-theists who
19:07
are saying this and
19:09
uh one of those concepts may be
19:11
teleology purpose
19:13
perhaps we need to put purpose back into
19:16
scientific equations which has been
19:19
taken out of ever since darwin
19:22
the whole idea of evolution is it's
19:24
blind right the blind watchmaker it has
19:26
no direction
19:28
no purpose
19:29
well the direction we know is wrong
19:31
simon conway morris has shown that
19:34
there is a direction in evolution
19:37
through
19:38
through you know his amazing studies on
19:40
the burgess shale and other things he's
19:43
he has shown that there are constraints
19:45
evolution doesn't do just anything it
19:47
does only certain things and it does it
19:49
over and over and over again
19:51
so there's a direction there there are
19:54
laws that seem to govern what actually
19:56
can happen it's not all random chance
20:00
we need to find out what those laws are
20:02
and we need to find out what they're
20:03
about and here's where i think
20:05
philosophy becomes very important
20:08
because scientists are not good at
20:09
figuring out what
20:11
what you know is the basis of science
20:15
once they make a discovery and they find
20:17
the law fine they can then write an
20:19
equation and have it as a law
20:21
but oftentimes
20:23
it it takes some thought and some new
20:26
approaches i mean einstein had to use a
20:28
whole different mathematical approach to
20:29
get where he got
20:31
i think we're going to need to do the
20:32
same thing and i think that what we will
20:35
find
20:37
is that those new approaches including
20:39
something like teleology are going to
20:41
point even more than they do now
20:44
to a divine being
20:46
a divine designer so i want to kind of
20:48
get an overview of your your journey so
20:51
you
20:52
encountered these different things in
20:54
science and uh let's just get a quick
20:56
summary of those so a biogenesis
20:58
quantum mechanics was there anything
21:00
else that really stuck out well the
21:02
fine-tuning argument fine-tuning
21:04
argument okay really i i learned about
21:06
that later but yes that was definitely
21:10
so those were some of the signs was
21:11
there anything else scientifically that
21:14
well there's actually a lot of other
21:16
things that some of them are not very
21:18
well known but
21:19
uh just the idea that
21:22
there's a lot in physics that is not
21:24
known and is very surprising and
21:27
physicists themselves some of them are
21:29
getting a little nervous
21:30
because it looks like the cern for
21:32
example the cern
21:34
collider has not given the results that
21:36
people are hoping for a lot of theories
21:38
have been thrown out
21:39
i can't go into the details because i'm
21:41
not a physicist and uh you know uh
21:45
this is just from what i'm reading
21:47
so and and there are other parts of
21:49
biology that uh are
21:52
incredibly suggestive of something way
21:55
beyond anything we can understand
21:57
including
21:58
consciousness including human behavior i
22:01
mean
22:02
the idea that evolution that darwinian
22:04
evolution by natural selection explains
22:07
why
22:08
you know we are we have morality or
22:10
explains why
22:12
we're creative or we love music
22:15
that's just nonsense that's not even
22:17
scientific
22:18
those are stories okay
22:21
uh so what makes us human what does it
22:23
mean to be in the image of god well we
22:25
have a sense right everybody has a sense
22:28
that human beings are
22:31
not just animals who are smart
22:35
some people deny that and i have never
22:38
even as an atheist i never went along
22:40
with that view i always knew
22:43
that human beings were somehow special
22:45
very special
22:46
i didn't know why i didn't know where it
22:48
came from but
22:50
now i think i do
Dreams
22:52
so then
22:53
that was kind of a summary of the the
22:55
science that kind of led you toward
22:56
theism but then
22:58
what about what was like i know you
23:00
mentioned like there were several
23:01
different experiences that you had at
23:02
church and dreams and everything what
23:04
was one that really stuck out to you
23:06
that really contributed to your eventual
23:08
accepting christianity is true
23:11
well i can as uh i can talk i can tell
23:14
you about uh one of the dreams which
23:18
there were two main ones that
23:20
i believe involved
23:22
intercession from
23:24
the spirit were you at this time were
23:26
you like really investigating were you
23:29
reading scripture a lot were not praying
23:31
the first one the first one uh i wasn't
23:34
even thinking about
23:36
christianity or belief i was an agnostic
23:39
i didn't know what was going on okay
23:42
and i didn't understand the dream at all
23:43
when i had it and it was a very
23:46
frightening dream because i i don't like
23:49
heights and i was hanging from the edge
23:52
of a cliff
23:54
terrified
23:56
i didn't know what to do and i couldn't
23:58
climb up i was holding on with my hands
24:02
and i screamed out help help i didn't
24:04
know who i was calling to i just said
24:05
help help and i heard a voice say just
24:08
let go.
24:10
and i said what what
24:13
i fall down
24:14
and the voice said just let go.
24:17
so i finally said well okay so i let go
24:21
and the moment i let go the entire
24:23
landscape turned
24:25
90 degrees
24:27
and instead of hanging from a cliff i
24:29
was lying on the ground
24:34
and there was a man
24:37
whose voice voice i had heard standing
24:39
there
24:40
that was the man who said just let go
24:44
i woke up and i was like
24:46
whoa
24:47
what was that
24:50
i didn't know what he meant by just let
24:52
go
24:53
i didn't know who it was
24:57
and then eventually
24:59
of course
25:01
i found out that of course the man was
25:03
jesus christ and what i had to let go of
25:07
was all the baggage that was in my life
25:09
that was preventing me
25:11
absolutely blocking me from even
25:13
considering the idea of a god
25:16
and i eventually i did let go of all of
Another Dream
25:18
that
25:18
wow
25:19
that's crazy
25:21
was there another one you mentioned
25:23
the other one was later and the other
25:25
one
25:26
the other one was i was already thinking
25:29
about
25:30
maybe believing in something i don't
25:33
remember exactly where i was but what i
25:35
do know is i had never been to a church
25:38
yet
25:39
other than that one catholic church i
25:40
might have been there already but i had
25:42
never were they wearing the franciscans
25:44
was that were they like brown robes yeah
25:46
yeah yeah that freaked me out a little
25:47
wasn't that cool though it was kind of
25:48
it was cool it was cool they were very
25:50
cool people they were really nice uh
25:53
like a little rope yeah a little rope
25:55
yeah i thought that was weird did they
25:57
did they like shave their heads i don't
25:58
remember that they might have yeah i
26:00
don't remember
26:02
catholics man catholics yeah wow
26:07
so that's another story yeah so tell me
26:09
tell me about that so i had and i had
26:11
not read i had not yet read the gospel
26:13
that's definite
26:15
uh so i had the dream that i was walking
26:18
around the garden trying to get in a
26:19
walled garden
26:21
and i couldn't get in i i it was very
26:23
steep walls and i was kept trying to
26:25
climb up and i i found vines and little
26:28
things that but i couldn't get to the
26:29
top and i got really frustrated i kept
26:31
going around
26:32
and i and then i saw a man and and he
26:34
said what's good matter with you and i
26:36
said i want to get in and i can't climb
26:38
over he said well then use the door
26:39
there it is
26:46
so i walked in
26:48
opened the door and walked in and there
26:50
was the garden
26:52
and
26:56
later
26:57
when i was in church i think the first
27:00
time i went to the church i'm now a
27:01
member of
27:03
there was a picture of jesus knocking on
27:06
the door
27:08
but i had never heard that knock on the
27:10
door and you know if you knock it will
27:12
be open for you that was
27:15
i had yet to read that
27:18
but i dreamed it
27:22
so that that had a big effect on me as
27:25
you can see yeah i'm like about to start
27:27
turning up myself
27:29
um
27:31
yeah i mean i don't think there's a
27:32
there's a whole lot more for us to to
27:34
cover in this short interview but is it
27:36
yeah is there is there anything you'd
27:38
like to leave
27:39
with the audience before we close it out
27:42
yeah i i think i have one main message i
27:44
think i i think i was
27:46
called as so many of us are called
27:50
to give one message to
27:53
people who are
27:56
questioning their faith especially if
27:58
they're questioning it because of
27:59
science
28:00
and
28:01
that's the reason i wrote my book it's
28:03
the reason i'm writing excuse me
28:05
articles
28:07
science and christian faith are
28:09
absolutely not in conflict i understand
28:12
that people growing up in faith
28:14
occasionally
28:16
will uh will lose it for various reasons
28:19
but one of those reasons should never be
28:21
science okay because
28:23
science is not anti-christian
28:26
science is not atheistic
28:28
christianity uh
28:31
was instrumental in the foundation of
28:33
science in the beginning of science all
28:34
the original scientists were
28:36
christians
28:38
and that remains there are still many
28:40
many scientists who are christians
28:41
despite the current atmosphere which is
28:44
somewhat hostile to christianity
28:47
but uh
28:48
my prediction is what i see now
28:51
happening is that atheists are beginning
28:53
to deny the reality of science you find
28:56
atheists saying no no the universe
28:58
didn't have a beginning it's been there
28:59
forever
29:01
no
29:02
they say that dna is not a code there's
29:04
no genetic code it's not a real code
29:07
wrong
29:09
and the reason these are not scientists
29:11
necessarily but they're atheists who
29:12
think they they are seeing this from
29:15
various people
29:17
and the reason they're attacking
29:19
scientific facts
29:20
because they are
29:22
is because the scientific facts are
29:24
pointing more and more
29:26
to what they don't want to accept which
29:28
is that
29:30
this world
29:31
has a creator
29:33
and everything we see is is part of the
29:36
creation including ourselves
29:39
so
29:41
if you are being told
29:44
that you have to choose between science
29:46
and your christian faith
29:48
reject that whoever told you that is
29:51
wrong
29:52
it's not true
29:55
what's true is christianity
