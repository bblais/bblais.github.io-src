0:00
what I am amazed at is that serious
0:02
thinkers today continue to ask us to
0:06
choose between God and science that's
0:09
like asking people to choose between
0:11
Henry Ford and Engineering as an
0:13
explanation of the Motorcar what you're
0:15
about to listen to is absolutely
0:17
exceptional it's John Linux with Oxford
0:20
Union making his case for God it's
0:23
extremely dense he packs a lot into a
0:27
little amount of time so feel free to
0:29
pause rewind whatever you need to to
0:31
make sure that you're really grasping
0:33
each and every idea that he lays out
0:34
with that being said let's go ahead and
0:35
dive in I believe in
0:37
God I believe in the Supernatural God
0:42
who created the heavens and the
0:45
earth I believe in a God who holds the
0:49
heavens and the Earth in
0:52
existence I believe that on the basis of
0:55
rational evidence and as we look at at
0:58
the rise of Science and the 16th and
1:00
17th centuries Alfred North Whitehead
1:03
and many others commented that men
1:06
became scientific because they expected
1:08
law in nature and they expected law in
1:11
nature because they believed in a
1:13
lawgiver so ladies and gentlemen I'm not
1:16
ashamed of being both a scientist and a
1:19
Christian because arguably Christianity
1:22
gave me my subject what I am amazed at
1:25
is that serious thinkers today continue
1:28
to ask us to choose between God and
1:32
science that's like asking people to
1:34
choose between Henry Ford and
1:36
Engineering as an explanation of the
1:38
motor car so good when Newton discovered
1:41
his law of gravity he didn't say I've
1:43
got a law I don't need God no he wrote
1:46
the principia Mathematica arguably the
1:48
greatest work in the whole history of
1:51
science because he saw that God is not
1:54
the same kind of explanation as a
1:56
scientific explanation God doesn't
1:59
compete
2:00
agency does not compete with mechanism
2:02
and
2:04
law why is there something rather than
2:07
nothing Alan Sandage the brilliant
2:09
cosmologist who became a Christian in
2:11
his 50s said God is the answer to that
2:14
question but people are now so desperate
2:17
to show that the universe created itself
2:19
from nothing which seems to me to be an
2:21
immediate oxymoron if I say x created y
2:25
I'm assuming the existence of x to
2:27
explain the existence of Y if I say X
2:30
created X I'm assuming the existence of
2:32
x to explain the existence of X which
2:35
simply shows that nonsense remains
2:36
nonsense even if High powerered
2:38
scientists utter it that might be worth
2:40
rewinding in case you missed it the
2:42
first time that is such a good point it
2:45
reminds me a little bit of GK Chester
2:47
and who said it is absurd to complain
2:50
that it is Unthinkable for an
2:52
unthinkable God to make everything out
2:54
of nothing and then to pretend that it
2:57
is more thinkable that nothing should
2:58
turn itself into everything
3:00
thing the heavens declare the glory of
3:03
God says the ancient
3:05
Psalm and we've unraveled a bit of that
3:08
seeing the fine choing of the
3:10
fundamental forces of nature it's
3:13
something that's so striking to
3:14
scientists that it demands
3:18
explanation and it seems to me that arop
3:20
penus hit it right he is the Nobel Prize
3:24
winner who discovered the microwave
3:26
background on which a lot of the
3:28
evidence for the big is based he said
3:30
astronomy leads us to a unique event a
3:33
universe which was created out of
3:35
nothing one with the very delicate
3:37
balance needed to provide exactly the
3:40
right conditions required to permit life
3:42
and one which has an underlying one
3:45
might say Supernatural plan but I want
3:49
to come to what I think is one of the
3:52
fundamental Arguments for
3:55
theism I take it this house believes in
3:58
reason that's why we're all here and as
4:02
a scientist I believe that the universe
4:05
is rationally
4:06
intelligible that is something that has
4:08
struck some of the Geniuses of science
4:11
as demanding an
4:13
explanation Einstein said the only
4:15
incomprehensible thing about the
4:17
universe is that it's comprehensible and
4:19
vigner talked about the unreasonable
4:23
effectiveness of mathematics how is it
4:25
that a mathematician thinking in her
4:27
head in here can come up with equations
4:29
that it seemed to fit the universe out
4:31
there well how is it indeed because the
4:34
irony of the atheist position here is
4:36
evident my atheist friends and I have
4:38
many of them tell me that the driving
4:41
force of evolution which eventually
4:43
produced our human cognitive faculties
4:45
reason included was not primarily
4:47
concerned with truth at all but with
4:50
survival and we all know ladies and
4:52
gentlemen what has often happened and
4:55
still happens to truth when individuals
4:57
or commercial Enterprises or nations
4:59
feel themselves threatened and struggle
5:02
for
5:03
survival a leading philosopher Alvin
5:05
planting of notredame says if atheists
5:08
are right that we are the product of
5:10
mindless unguided natural processes then
5:13
they have given us strong reason to
5:15
doubt the reliability of human cognitive
5:17
faculties and therefore inevitably to
5:19
doubt the validity of any belief that
5:21
they produce including their atheism
5:24
their biology and their belief in
5:26
naturalism would therefore appear to be
5:28
at war with each other in a conflict
5:30
that is nothing at all to do with God
5:33
yet my atheist friends still insist that
5:36
it is rational for them to believe that
5:39
the evolution of human reason was not
5:42
directed for the purpose of discovering
5:43
truth and yet it is irrational for me to
5:47
believe that human reason was designed
5:49
and created by God to enable us to
5:52
understand and believe the truth curious
5:56
logic by contrast with that biblical
6:00
theism asserts that Ultimate Reality is
6:03
personal and intelligent and the reason
6:05
science works and this was the
6:08
motivating force that drove the great
6:09
pioneers of science is that the Universe
6:12
out there and the human mind in here
6:14
that does the science are ultimately the
6:17
product of the same intelligent Divine
6:21
mind human beings are made we are told
6:24
in God's image and that means that
6:27
science can be done that makes
6:30
infinitely more sense to me as a
6:32
scientist than atheism
6:35
does now let me come briefly to ethics
6:38
ethical Behavior like rational behavior
6:40
of course does not itself require
6:42
religious belief this is consistent with
6:45
the fact that humans are created in
6:48
God's image as rational moral persons
6:51
but just as I suggest that rationality
6:54
cannot be explained without the
6:56
existence of God so I dare to suggest
6:59
that that the existence of morality
7:01
cannot be explained either as modern
7:04
science sprang from judeo-christian
7:06
sources so did the concept of human
7:09
equality listen to atheist Jurgen habas
7:12
arguably one of Germany's leading
7:14
intellectuals he said that
7:16
universalistic egalitarianism from which
7:18
sprang the ideals of freedom and a
7:21
collective life and solidarity the
7:23
individual morality of conscience human
7:25
rights and democracy is the direct
7:27
Legacy of the judaic ethic of justice
7:30
and the Christian ethic of love this
7:33
Legacy substantially
7:36
unchanged has been the object of
7:38
continual critical appropriation and
7:40
reinterpretation to this day there's no
7:43
alternative to it everything else is
7:45
just Idol postmodern talk and it seems
7:49
to me he's hitting the core of something
7:51
important because the value of a human
7:54
being on which such egalitarian is of is
7:57
based not on what the human being can do
7:59
but what she's made of or how she's made
8:02
in God's
8:04
image I never forget speaking when on
8:07
one of my many visits to Russia to a
8:11
colleague in the Academy of Sciences and
8:14
he said you know John we thought we
8:17
could abolish God and retain a value for
8:19
human beings we found we couldn't and we
8:22
murdered millions of them and Alexander
8:25
suiton has said if I'm ask why is it
8:28
that 60 million of my fellow countrymen
8:30
were sacrificed he said the answer is we
8:34
have forgotten
8:37
God science of course marvelous that it
8:41
is is limited even a Nobel Prize winner
8:44
by analyzing a cake cannot tell why it
8:47
was made but aunt Matilda who made it
8:50
can tell you she can reveal it to you
8:53
but if she doesn't reveal it to you
8:55
you'll never know and that brings me to
8:57
be my next evidence it's the same with
9:00
the universe we can analyze it
9:02
magnificently But ultimately if it has a
9:05
maker and I believe it has only he can
9:08
tell us what it's all about and he's
9:10
done so in the powerful Narrative of the
9:12
Bible in particular in its analysis of
9:16
the problem with Humanity not simply in
9:18
terms of Behavioral breakdown between
9:21
people but a vertical breakdown of trust
9:24
between us and the
9:26
Creator the unique solution to that
9:30
problem is not simply in terms of human
9:33
ethical development although that's very
9:35
important but in terms of something far
9:37
deeper altto together the restoration of
9:40
the fractured relationship with God
9:43
through the Salvation he has brought
9:44
through Jesus Christ a radical
9:47
relationship that empowers us to live
9:51
ethically from God and here we reach
9:53
what for me is a chief evidence not only
9:56
for the Existence but the nature of God
9:59
it is Jesus Christ he it was who not
10:02
only taught the Golden Rule but embodied
10:04
it fed the hungry healed the sick and
10:06
suffering and welcomed society's
10:08
outcasts brought honor and respect to
10:11
the marginalized and ashamed and he's
10:13
brought forgiveness and peace to
10:16
multi-millions uh around the world he's
10:19
able to do this of course because though
10:22
he was a man he uniquely never was only
10:25
a man but God become human
10:30
the central evidence for this startling
10:34
claim is of course his historical
10:36
Resurrection from the dead that launched
10:39
Christianity in the world this is of
10:41
course ladies and gentlemen a crunch
10:43
issue if Jesus rose from the dead death
10:46
is not the end and Atheism is false if
10:49
Jesus did rise did did not rise from the
10:52
dead Christianity is false and I
10:55
remember at Cambridge as a student
10:57
listening to the brilliant sir nor
10:59
Anderson a legal expert going through
11:02
forensically the evidence from his legal
11:05
perspective as a a brilliant lawyer and
11:09
he said at the end of it the empty tomb
11:12
then of Jesus forms a veritable rock on
11:15
which all rationalistic theories of the
11:17
Resurrection Dash themselves in vain
11:20
just finally now as I read the Bible I
11:23
do not only find intellectual
11:25
satisfaction but I find a great deal of
11:27
that I sense The Voice of God speaking
11:30
to me you see that's intensely personal
11:33
but ladies and gentlemen we've been
11:34
asked tonight about belief in God and I
11:38
want to strongly emphasize that God is
11:40
not a theory he's a person and if the
11:44
origination of meqa person is a personal
11:48
God then the most exciting thing really
11:51
is is there a possibility of getting to
11:53
know
11:54
God and so I don't simply believe there
11:57
is a God I've come to know him and trust
12:00
him and I have strong reasons for doing
12:03
so because of Christ dying and Rising
12:07
again from me and that has generated in
12:10
me a sense of utterly unmar forgiveness
12:13
acceptance and peace that has enabled me
12:16
to face the ugly side of my own nature
12:19
and with God's help to do something
12:21
about it but it's enabled me to face
12:22
something else the hardest problem I
12:25
face as a Christian is the problem of
12:28
evil and
12:31
pain my niece getting a tumor at 22 that
12:36
kills her what do I say to my sister and
12:40
this is the hardest problem we face but
12:43
it seems to me that atheism here has no
12:46
answer because by definition atheism
12:49
believes that human death is the end so
12:52
there is no ultimate
12:55
hope but you see ladies and gentlemen we
12:58
could stay here till midnight and Beyond
13:01
arguing as has been done in this
13:03
University for centuries what a good god
13:06
should might would could if not possibly
13:09
might just could he not have done and
13:12
we'll get nowhere so it seems to me
13:15
there's another question we can ask and
13:16
it's this granted that life is presents
13:20
us with a double picture we see some
13:23
beautiful things we see some ragged
13:26
edges we see hurt and pain and we see
13:29
Joy how can we come to terms with that
13:33
and it seems to me here is no simplistic
13:36
answer but a window into an answer and
13:38
it's this if it is actually true that
13:42
Jesus is as I believe him to be the Son
13:44
of God then we can ask the question what
13:46
is God doing on a
13:48
cross and the answer comes back at the
13:51
very least God is Not remain distant
13:54
from our human suffering but has become
13:56
part of it and the other side of that is
14:00
this because Jesus rose from the dead he
14:03
is going to be the ultimate judge now
14:06
here's an irony because atheism has no
14:10
ultimate hope of Justice by definition
14:13
the vast majority of people in the
14:16
history of the world have died without
14:17
Justice and will die without Justice and
14:20
if death is the end then of course they
14:23
have no hope of ultimate justice but the
14:26
promise in the New Testament guaranteed
14:29
by the resurrection of Jesus is that he
14:31
is to be the judge in the coming day so
14:35
ladies and
14:36
gentlemen those are some of the reasons
14:40
why I believe that God is real and
14:42
worthy to be trusted thank you when
14:45
Christians talk about God it is personal
14:47
it's not fantasy it's not the spaghetti
14:50
monster in the sky there is a reality of
14:53
God when when you have accepted him on
14:56
his terms that is completely undeniable
14:58
it is as undeniable as my relationship
15:01
with my wife in the other room if if you
15:03
were to tell me that she's not real I
15:04
would laugh at you in the same way that
15:06
if you were to tell me that God is not
15:08
real but that type of knowing is not
15:10
accessible to someone who hasn't met God
15:12
on his terms there's this this conceit
15:15
and this arrogance that actually gets
15:16
directly in the way of the knowing of
15:18
God and the relationship of God and so I
15:21
just love what Linux says here because
15:23
he starts with sort of unpacking like
15:25
why is scientism the philosophy of
15:29
science as the only epistemology why is
15:30
that reductionistic then he walks into
15:32
human rights into morality and and
15:34
ultimately down to the extremely
15:35
personal level which is where all of
15:37
these conversations must end so um all
15:40
this being said I hope that someone uh
15:42
listening to this if anyone is still
15:44
listening to this appreciated that as
15:45
much as I did because I think that it's
15:47
a mistake to break apart these pieces
15:50
and to only talk about this to only talk
15:51
about this a lot of my videos focus on
15:53
like the the moral case for God but
15:56
really it is like this tapestry where
15:58
all of these threads are connected
16:00
together in this you know this Christian
16:02
world view and it's when the threads are
16:05
working together and you can see the
16:07
whole I think Linux does a phenomenal
16:09
job in this of of beginning to reveal
16:13
that picture of reality all that being
16:15
said I hope you guys like this video and
16:16
I'll see you in the next one thanks bye
