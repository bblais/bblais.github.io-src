0:00
the greatest Miracle of all time the resurrection how did you integrate that into your scientific worldview with with
0:07
surprisingly little difficulty the Bible is not a science
0:12
book we know everything except what's going on with the origin of Life there shouldn't be life life should not exist
0:18
it doesn't make any sense that matter is crawling around and doing things the more we learn about science the more we
0:25
see pointers to God the purpose of the Bible is to give glory to God and to tell the people reading it this is what
0:32
happen and this is who you are you're good and you're bad you're sad and you're joyful you know you're dumb and
0:40
you're smart you're humans hey welcome to capturing Christianity I am here in
0:46
person again with Dr Sai Gart Sai it's great to be with you again this is actually sort of an extension of our
0:52
previous talk that is nearing how many views a million views at this point where we looked at the science that led
0:58
you from atheism to Christianity and so this is kind of an extension of that interview we want to
1:04
to go deeper into the second part of your book which is basically what does it look like to be a scientist as a
1:11
Christian you know what is the sort of what is the aftermath of becoming a Christian as a scientist well I think
1:18
where we ended last time and also happens to be the end of the first part
1:23
of my book was that I had had this experience and I realized that I was a
1:29
believer and I said out loud I'm a Believer and everything changed from
1:34
that moment but what happened next is the next thing
1:41
I said to myself is now what yeah because I knew very little about
1:49
Christianity other than what I had read in the Bible and I had read uh a few
1:56
other things like the uh the Catholic Cath ISM and some other things but I
2:03
didn't know what it meant I didn't know anything about churches I didn't know
2:08
anything about how a scientist could be a Christian uh what did it mean I would
2:16
have to give up my scientific worldview I I didn't know any other would you have
2:21
to become a young Earth creationist oh yeah I I honestly but I have to drop Evolution as a as a as something that I
2:29
held to be correct I didn't know any other uh
2:34
colleagues of mine in the Sciences who were Christians were you scared I wasn't scared I had a very my
2:42
belief was so strong my it was such a powerful experience to come into that
2:48
belief system that that I I felt that that would sustain me but I didn't know
2:54
what to do so I just kept very quiet I didn't tell anyone that I I had had this
3:01
experience I I didn't announce to anyone that I'm now a Christian nobody
3:08
nobody uh I I I didn't know I was afraid of
3:13
what I was afraid of was what would happen after I said that would when people say to me are you nuts are you
3:22
crazy uh so I didn't know what to do and and I also had questions for myself I I
3:29
I didn't know um you know how I would deal with all
3:36
the things that I had been taught like the idea that Christianity was
3:41
responsible for so much of the historical evil in human civilization was that
3:47
true so I had a lot of work to do and I started doing it I started reading a lot
3:53
more about history about the history of the church uh world history in general which
4:00
history was always one of my favorite subjects so I love reading history anyway but the history that I had read
4:06
had been very negative with respect to Christianity and I started reading other
4:12
history uh there's plenty of it out there and realized that everything a lot of things I had been taught were either
4:18
exaggerated or simply not true can you give me an example sure um often you
4:24
will see people saying that Christianity was responsible for all or most or the
4:30
majority of wars and deaths and horrible things that happen in history that's completely false uh there
4:38
are all you have to do is look at Wikipedia this it's very clear that if
4:44
you look at the history of Wars Christian wars either Wars of Christians against others or between Christians
4:51
account for about 5% of the total deaths in world history uh the rest being totally
5:00
non-religious War actually that's religious wars that even includes Islam
5:05
and other religions the uh the reality is that most deaths occur most Warfare occurs
5:13
and most you know killings and deaths of people by other people occur in
5:19
non-religious contexts okay well that was nice to understand you know when
5:24
people say oh what what about the Crusades what about the Inquisition yeah those were bad things but they were
5:30
minor in comparison to things like some of the Chinese Civil Wars which had
5:36
nothing to do with religion or some of the other horrible events like uh many
5:42
of them in the 20th century the second world war the effect of Chinese communism on on survival and things like
5:50
that so that was helpful uh I also began looking more uh into the whole question
5:57
of whether it was possible for Christians to be I'm sorry for scientists to be Christian and I was very fortunate
6:05
because roughly at that time I discovered a fairly recent book at the time uh published by Francis Collins who
6:13
I had no idea was a Christian I certainly knew who he was he was a very famous geneticist who was at that time
6:20
leading the human genome Research Institute and human and the Human Genome
6:26
Project and he wrote a book called the language of God and I read
6:32
that and I'm it's still an extremely popular book all these years later and
6:38
uh it it opened it opened everything for me because you know this is one of the
6:44
most brilliant scientists in our time who is a completely devout
6:50
Evangelical Christian and I didn't know that at all what is one big takeaway from the book that you remember the huge
6:58
one was simply that there was no conflict between science and religious
7:03
faith and you remember in our last interview that's how I ended the discussion was I said if this you asked
7:10
me what is the takeaway message that I want to bring and that's it that there is no conflict between Christian
7:18
religion Christianity and scientific faith and if you're told that there is it's false so roughly how did he argue
7:25
for that or how did he convince you of that thesis well he the book
7:31
describes the language of God as of course the genetic code and and he is a geneticist and he knows everything there
7:38
is to know about DNA and and genetics and he talks about the science and he
7:45
talks about his faith he came to Faith through an interesting uh process which involved
7:52
issues like the moral code he was a physician at one point active clinically
7:58
active in hospital wards and a dying patient of his asked him
8:03
what do you believe in doctor because he he saw that this woman who was dying
8:09
knew she was dying was very calm and she was a very religious Christian and when she asked him what do
8:17
you believe in he realized he didn't have an answer and that got him thinking and the
8:25
the the final step for him was a time when he was hiking and he looked around
8:31
and he was just simply overcome by the beauty of God's creation the beauty Beauty played a big part and putting
8:38
okay so lots of people know that nature is beautiful yeah but he put that together with This Woman's
8:45
question what you believe in and look at the beauty of Nature and he realized at
8:51
that point that he was a believer in God in the Creator now the difference
8:57
between Francis and I was that that that Francis had had not grown up as a
9:04
Christian but his family was somewhat you know they went to church occasionally
9:10
apparently and uh so it he didn't have to go through many stages that I had to
9:16
go through which I talked about last time uh he W he just he it all came
9:23
together for him and and that's what often happens everything just comes together and
9:28
makesense and when I read that book and I finished it and I saw you know the
9:34
testimony of Francis Collins that it all came together for him as it had come
9:40
finally for me through the work of the holy spirit that was an another I wouldn't
9:48
say another help to my faith because I was already there but it was a reinforcement and it allowed me to not
9:56
worry so much about how will I make it in the world as a scientist you know
10:02
which I was still actively doing research um with
10:07
this what I used to call crazy worldview and I had the confidence
10:14
to go ahead and not only that I had the confidence to seek out other Christians
10:19
in the sciences and I found them uh I got online I started looking I
10:26
I discovered biologos which had been started by Francis Collins biologos is a
10:32
is a group of Christians who hold completely to mainstream science
10:38
including Evolution and then I discovered something called the American Scientific affiliation which is a uh a
10:47
group of a fairly large group three or 4 thousand members of scientists many of
10:53
whom are uh on the faculty of Christian colleges not all but many
10:59
and others are just uh you know they're Christians and scientists and that's a very active organization I joined it I'm
11:06
now a fellow so it's a very important organization they don't have a particular they don't have any standard
11:13
view on science so there are young Earth creationists there are ID people
11:18
evolutionary creationists so it's different from biologos which is only evolutionary creation so that was you
11:26
know that that took a few more years that was in 2010 when I first discovered that that
11:32
organization uh and of course later I discovered others reasons to believe uh
11:38
Hugh Ross buana is now has just taken over that I've met them both wonderful
11:44
people uh their ideology related to science is uh is old Earth uh and not
11:54
completely on board with everything in evolution they have some questions about that but again I'm sort of now in the
12:00
middle there myself uh what do you mean well I'm I I
12:05
consider myself an evolutionary creationist still but I also have for
12:11
many years been questioning the completeness of evolution and I'm going to talk about that uh
12:19
tomorrow uh I I don't think that evolution is a complete Theory I think we need to expand it and I'm not alone
12:26
there are many people who agree with that not all of most of them not theists in fact but I happen to hold the belief
12:33
that the more we learn about science the more we see pointers to God
12:41
that was true in physics uh physics in the 19 century was
12:46
very mechanical very deterministic when Einstein and Plank
12:51
and all the quantum theorists Heisenberg Etc renewed physics in the 20th century
12:57
when physics became freed of its deterministic strictures uh I think many
13:06
pointers to God appeared we have the fine-tuning of the constants the cosmological constants we have the
13:12
uncertainty principle which tells us we can't know everything about everything from from science it's
13:17
impossible uh these are all scientific this is not gaps these are scientific knowledge that point us to the reality
13:24
of the Creator and I and that has not happened in bi biology because for historical
13:32
reasons biologists have always been very defensive about metaphysics and about
13:38
the possibility of letting the camel of theology into the tent so it's
13:45
it's there is a a very prevalent
13:50
philosophical I would say almost religious attitude in biology to keep
13:55
out anything that looks like it's not strictly determinist and reductionist
14:01
mhm now the theory of evolution kind of does that because it doesn't require
14:07
anything other than just you know natural naturalism um but it's not
14:13
complete there are things missing there are things that can't explain and we talked about this last time the main one
14:19
is abiogenesis but that's not the only one there are many things that don't fit
14:24
uh especially things about humans human biology human characteristics and many other things as well and I I'll be
14:31
talking about some of that what I think is going to happen is that biology will
14:37
progress the way physics did for the same reason we're we're stuck at this point we we get a we still getting good
14:45
data and new knowledge about a lot of the details of how cells work about the
14:51
molecular biology and the biochemistry of life but we're not making substantial
14:57
progress in large areas you know it's like it's like physics knew everything except what's going on with light okay
15:04
they couldn't figure that out and we know everything except what's going on with the origin of life and we're not
15:10
getting we're not getting there we need a breakthrough a paradigm
15:15
breakthrough as I've often said I don't believe that God Did It is an answer I
15:20
do believe that God did it but God did everything yeah so what I'm interested
15:27
in is to learn learn more about how God did life the same way we learn more
15:35
about how God did the universe nothing we've learned in any
15:41
science has ever eliminated God from the picture in my view it's just just the
15:47
opposite we know there was a big bang we know there was an origin of the
15:52
universe but we don't know how and why that happened how you know how sometimes
15:58
we know things why we never do now is why something that is should
16:04
never be discussed in physics I don't think so or in any science I think that
16:11
sometimes we really do want to ask why and I think life is one of those things
16:16
why is there life there shouldn't be life life should not exist uh it doesn't make any sense that
16:24
matter is crawling around and doing things and and some of the things that
16:30
these that these single that matter does in in living cells is
16:35
remarkable I mean I'm not just talking about us I'm talking about bacteria they they have
16:42
purpose and they have agency they act they do things on
16:49
purpose bacteria do that and and so do plants and so do all animals and of course we do
16:56
too why is that where did that come from now we can easily say well that's all
17:03
evidence of God's existence of God's you know purposes and and and that's
17:09
absolutely true but I think that we can also maybe I'm not sure about this but I think we can approach it scientifically
17:15
as well I think we but we need new theories we need new ideas uh we can't do it based on this
17:23
purely reductionist bottomup view of biology which is the dominant field right now
17:31
and even within Evolution and within evolutionary theory there are people and
17:37
again not necessarily theists who are making progress in that area they are
17:43
looking at things like agency and purpose thology
17:49
in current biological systems and asking the question where did this come from
17:55
how did this happen and looking for scientific answers
18:00
do you mind if we switch gears and talk about miracles yeah so yeah Miracles how
18:05
because one way to put the conflict or the potential conflict between science and Christianity is that at the
18:12
center of Christianity is this great miracle the great miracle the resurrection right and so did that ever
18:18
come up in in your mind of like how can I be yeah how can I maintain my science
18:24
which is based on a sort of methodological naturalism where you're not allowing in any kind of external
18:31
agency into your explanations how did you resolve that conflict that potential conflict between miracles on the one
18:37
hand and the greatest Miracle of all time the resurrection how did you you
18:42
know integrate that into your scientific worldview as a scientist yeah I
18:48
I with with surprisingly little difficulty and all all all I answer all
18:56
I had to do was say yeah there's a lot of things we can't explain but we know are true we don't
19:04
call them Miracles um now and it doesn't mean that God stepped in and did them but the fact
19:12
that we can't explain the resurrection doesn't didn't bother me at all because there are many things we can't we can't
19:18
explain what a quark is you know we can't we can't explain what a uh what we
19:24
can't explain what charge is why is an electron negative and a proton on positive I mean you know we can we can
19:31
talk about it we can describe it but we don't really explain
19:37
it uh so so that but then the that doesn't are you saying that are you
19:42
saying that Miracles lack explanation no actually I I'm I'm uh what I'm saying is
19:49
that there are two things about miracles how do you explain them okay scientifically and that doesn't bother
19:55
me because there's a lot in science there's a lot in nature that we can't explain through
20:01
science but then the question is okay but Jesus rose from the dead that never happens right so how do you explain that
20:08
and uh I don't know you can't explain that or any miracle if you don't believe in
20:14
godh because then you all you can say is it didn't happen but miracles happen
20:20
right and there are examples of Miracles that are indisputable and
20:26
so what people are not religious say is well I don't know but it happened I mean
20:32
you know when doctors see something that they can't explain which happens very very frequently by the way uh they say I
20:39
don't know it's I've never seen it before but there it is yeah it's true I don't know the explanation I don't know the explanation I'm not going to find it
20:46
but it's it happened um Pastor uh I think his name is Dwayne Miller who got his voice back
20:53
as a very famous Lee stroble talked about that and I've heard that that tape and and there's no question that that
21:00
happened uh nobody could explain it this is a yeah what's remarkable about these
21:05
stories some of some of them is that you know they happen at a specific time the
21:10
timing of them yeah is what makes it peculiar and that's that's what really starts to raise questions is that like
21:17
his voice came back in the middle of a sermon right on I think he was talking about healing
21:24
yes at the moment that at the moment talking about that the next moment it it's his voice just came back everyone
21:31
should listen to that if they haven't already uh whether you're a Believer or not listen listen to that just as an
21:38
example but the resurrection was clearly not explainable and yes it's true that
21:45
no human has ever risen from the dead and never will unless they happen to be
21:52
God incarnate and Jesus Christ was God incarnate and so you yeah rising from
21:59
the dead doesn't bother me now if you're not a Believer that's not you can't use
22:04
that explanation um well so what about the idea that the laws of nature are
22:10
just so constant and so you know consistent
22:15
that we can rule out these types of Miracles as like the more likely explanation is going to be someone was
22:21
lying someone was mistaken so the these other options these other natural options seem a lot better than the
22:28
miracle well and I don't know what percentage anywhere from 20 to 90% of
22:34
cases of reported Miracles that may be true mhm but it's certainly not true of all of them and it's certainly not true
22:40
of of the Resurrection it strikes me as bias bias against miracles to say to say
22:46
that in every case you're going to it's going to be more likely that it's mistaken well I it's kind of like it's
22:53
kind of like magic uh okay I it's something I I talk about sometimes times
22:59
is that you know uh we're told that this
23:04
is all magic and there are many magicians who are very pen and Teller is
23:10
the best example who are really Fierce atheists who are atheists yeah and and and one of the things they like to do is
23:16
show that their magic tricks are all they're not there's nothing Supernatural about them and I I dabble in Magic I
23:24
used to dabble in Magic a little bit really yeah in fact I can you show me something right now I can't show it to
23:29
you right now but I can show it to you later okay uh I'm way too interested in this now I wish I wish I would have
23:35
known because then I would have had like a coin or something do we have something no no I can't I I I have a spe I I could
23:41
have brought it I brought it with me to here what is it it's a trick what what is the what does it involve oh I can't
23:48
tell you okay this is being recorded you know magician is not allowed to do that but I
23:55
could demonstrate it for for you later maybe I was even thinking of doing it during my talk but I I have too much to
24:02
say so I may bring sorry to get off off track that's okay but the point of the
24:07
the point of this whole thing is that yeah magic tricks involve natural
24:13
things but there is something a little beyond that the skill that a good
24:20
magician I'm not talking about myself here but somebody like pen brings to the
24:25
performance of magic m is somewhat miraculous in a way it's the
24:32
miracle of human humans being made in the image of God I mean what they can do the way the
24:40
psychological and the physical and the mental skills required to be a really
24:48
good stage magician are just are to me at the same level of being an amazing composer or a
24:55
brilliant poet H or a brilliant scientist they're they reflect the image
25:00
of God no other nothing other than a human can do a good magic
25:06
trick or even a bad magic trick and where does that come from to me one of
25:11
the Miracles of nature is the nature of humans in fact I think I wrote Somewhere
25:16
that you know we're used to Miracles and we call but we usually call it human
25:23
nature H but again back to the resurrection
25:28
ction that's a real Miracle wherein God it was a miracle
25:34
that God came to us in the form of a man MH and everything about that was
25:41
incredible he didn't come as a king came as a carpenter he didn't come to reassure One
25:50
Tribe of people and especially the wealthy among them he came to reassure the Sinners and the lost of all Humanity
26:01
he told us that we are all worthy all of us
26:07
sinners losers the despised the rejected no one
26:13
had ever said that before these things are all miracles even before the resurrection
26:21
happened no one had ever thought of these things and he changed the world
26:29
uh there's no no denying that yeah I mean that's a historical fact and unless you're a Jesus
26:37
mythicist you know flat earthers Jesus mythicists you know they're all they all
26:42
belong together I didn't say that that that I think somebody like Bart Man actually
26:49
said that anyway oh someone I don't remember who but um he changed the world
26:56
and and of course he was resurrected because he's with us he's
27:02
alive and he he rules in heaven and uh yeah Miracles don't bother me I and and
27:10
other Miracles Les of a lesser kind you know cure Health curing diseases
27:17
um uh just I mean I see Miracles so often that I I I you know I may merge
27:26
into just maybe just good luck I don't know but but I think that all of once
27:32
you're a human um so much is miraculous and and so much can be Trace back to this Miraculous Creation of humanity
27:40
that that God did um yeah I start to the more I think about miracles and like
27:45
laws of nature the less inclined I am to use those terms because yeah it makes
27:50
more sense to just ask what has God done yeah and the laws of nature I mean that's a fascinating discussion the
27:57
whole issue of the laws of nature nobody knew there were laws of nature until uh
28:02
you know some Greeks and then later the original Christian Scientists began
28:09
studying the laws of nature trying to show that there were such things and they were amazed nobody
28:17
thought that the same law that it works on Earth would would exist everywhere that in the universe so when Newton
28:24
showed that that was true that was considered and was an an amazing breakthrough in
28:31
knowledge that there are these universal laws of nature that apply everywhere and all the
28:37
time and that was a miracle that was considered miraculous
28:42
and it's not just that it exists everywhere throughout the whole universe it's that we have this specific set of
28:47
laws right and they specific all work together and they they work together and
28:52
what is miraculous is that we can understand them and we understand them
28:59
mathematically which is also miraculous because mathematics is a very abstract
29:04
very human way of thinking and we can express every law in
29:11
nature we've discovered mathematically and it works and many people have said that
29:17
doesn't make any sense why should why should we be able with our ways of
29:24
thinking which includes mathematics be able to write down a simple equation like fals ma right Force equals you know
29:33
mass time acceleration why does that work yeah it it that's like a
29:38
fine-tuning argument that's like God said okay I'm going to make it easy for you people okay to figure out how the
29:44
world Works to figure out how the world works and we did and because the world could have been way more chaotic sure
29:51
sure it could have been that when you throw a ball it goes up it goes down it goes sideways yeah and it could have
29:56
been goes in a curve the force equals you know 13 other terms to the eighth power divided by the you know the the
30:03
integral of something or other I mean you know there are some laws which are a little challenging in terms of calculus
30:09
but not for a mathematician yeah not for anyone who you know who has studied it so uh yeah it could have been or it
30:16
could have been Lawless the world could have been completely Lawless now what's interesting to me as a biologist is that
30:23
there are no laws in biology we have not found well have a couple of mathematical
30:29
laws in biology but they're always being violated there are always exceptions to
30:35
biological laws give me an example okay um so we have one of the few laws that
30:44
we have is the uh what's called the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium it has to do
30:50
with genetics okay and we you're gonna have to break this down yeah for me and the audience yeah uh I'm not going to
30:59
write down the equation but it's fairly simple it tells you what how the the various forms of a gene which
31:06
are called alals how the alal frequency changes and the reason that was important was because when people first
31:14
heard about Evolution they didn't understand and then they heard about uh uh the early genetics so that there are
31:21
dominant and recessive genes and people thought well if there's a dominant gene eventually it's going to
31:27
just take over and that's the end there won't be in so how do you get Evolution and there were two mathematicians who
31:34
heard about this independently Hardy and Weinberg two different guys and they
31:39
came up with a formula that showed that no there's an equilibrium between the dominant and the recessive forms of the
31:47
Gene and uh it stays it stays constant
31:52
unless there's a selection for one of those Al and then it can change and that's how
32:00
that's sort of one of the equations for evolution uh and shows that Evolution
32:05
Rel results in the change in AAL frequency and that equation is useful
32:12
but it's often violated it there are so many exceptions to that because uh
32:18
sometimes you get a an a third Al which then Works in
32:25
concert with one of the other two biology is so immensely complicated
32:31
biochemistry molecular biology cell biology is so incredibly complex that as
32:37
soon as you start to try to write down an equation you're going to find something that doesn't fit
32:43
it and I think that that's an amazing clue
32:49
to me that that itself is a pointer to God it's not just that biology is complex because complexity can be
32:56
explained the physical world was complex you look at a storm system it's very
33:01
complex but not at the level of biology it it it there's nothing that comes close to that
33:08
and every time you say something definite in biology the best example is
33:14
the central dogma which is that DNA gives RNA which makes protein that was
33:19
called the central dogma of biology and it was uh started by FR uh Francis Crick
33:27
and uh it was cons it was called the central dogma because there was that was
33:32
there's no exception proteins never make RNA RNA never makes DNA people thought
33:39
and DNA makes itself okay so that turns out in 1970 I was just starting graduate school
33:47
when uh two people again independently Baris and Bishop discovered that there's
33:53
a virus made out of RNA which makes DNA the RNA makes DNA and it's called you
34:01
know a retrovirus and we're very familiar with those now they include things like uh Aids HIV and uh other
34:10
well-known viruses and um it turns out that there's a specific enzyme called reverse
34:17
transcriptase which takes RNA and makes DNA out of it so we had to revise the central dogma put another arrow in so
34:24
the DNA to RNA also goes backwards this happens all the time all the time I
34:31
mean we used to think that GNA had sorry that junk DNA had no function that there was a
34:37
huge 98% not sorry 90% of the of the genome had no function at all turned out
34:44
that's not true there's all kinds of function in in DNA sequences that don't
34:49
make proteins but they regulate other genes and they have all kinds of other functions they RNA and too complex to go
34:57
into but is always we're always learning new new things and what half the time
35:03
the new things that we're learning contradict the other things that we thought we knew so that's going to keep happening
35:10
and uh and and the good news about that is there's some reason for that now
35:16
theologically it's clear to me is that the creation of Life by
35:21
God was miraculous and involved laws that we don't know yet
35:29
and scientifically what's exciting is the fact that we don't know those laws yet
35:35
because if they're there we'll find them I won't see it but I'm assuming that at
35:41
some point uh at least right now I can prophesize that we will find new forces
35:48
new natural forces that apply to biology and biology only to
35:55
life so going back to your story going back to like the the
36:00
beginning of this interview where we were looking at your your journey from right atheism to Christianity and what
36:06
that looked like and and sort of entailed in the aftermath of it so was there when you eventually came out as a
36:12
Christian to your friends and to your colleagues what what was the aftermath of that what was there blowback was
36:17
there a little uh one of my best friends is an atheist of course they all my
36:23
friends were atheists were they surprised yeah everybody was surprised she was this this one particular person
36:31
was um surprised but very accepting quite a few people
36:38
had that kind of reaction I think probably somewhere inside them they were
36:43
saying gee too bad I thought he was a smart [Laughter] guy uh others others uh were a little
36:51
bit more negative um some of my colleagues in particular although I didn't tell many people for quite a
36:57
while there was a lot of indifference you know uh I don't know what they were actually thinking uh some of them may
37:05
have been thinking things that some of the commenters on our last video mentioned you know well he's getting old
37:11
he's getting you know afraid of death whatever the excuses are for somebody who become converts and I'll just say
37:19
right now that yes a fear of death was something I experienced but in my 20s not not recently
37:27
so that's not part of it but one of the other things that I had to deal with was frankly the Bible and that was tough
37:36
what in particular well the whole Old Testament okay starting with Genesis and
37:41
some other stuff and I hadn't re I had never really read I mean I read the gospels which I
37:49
loved and I and later after I you know then I read the rest of the New Testament and I had no problem with
37:55
almost any of it ration is beyond me but that's another story but the Old Testament I I I I had
38:03
difficulty and luckily I was also reading some great theologians uh John
38:10
Walton uh John Walton is great he wonderful uh NT Wright uh who I had the
38:16
privilege of meeting once as a wonderful man nice brilliant Theologian kind like Santa Claus alist McGrath and what I
38:24
learned was that you know the Bible is not a science book it's not really even
38:29
a history book in a way it is in a way but it's a series of books of all
38:35
different genres and and yeah it it has all the defects
38:42
that everybody says it has it's contradictory it doesn't make sense it
38:48
it says all kinds of different things it has it has Heroes who are really
38:53
villainous I mean King David nice guy I don't think so uh and
39:00
then I it struck me at some point and I can't tell you when may have been what I
39:05
was reading about King David I realized this is a book about
39:12
truth this is not this is not a book that that's written to make you feel
39:17
good about about the world about everything it's written to tell you what is true it's written to tell you all you
39:24
have to do is read Ecclesiastes to yeah really see that yeah exactly yeah it it
39:30
I mean even even the really hard ones like numbers you know I mean it was
39:36
written if you if you read it right you see what the purpose of the writer was
39:42
it was it was the purpose of the Bible is to give glory to God and to tell the
39:47
people reading it this is what happened and this is who you are as people this
39:54
is who God created you're not wonderful you're not perfect you're good and
40:00
you're bad you're sad and you're joyful you know you're dumb and you're
40:09
smart you're humans M and you were made it by and you were made by God you were
40:14
created by God In His Image and that's a miracle that's wonderful that doesn't mean that you're
40:21
living in in heaven you're not living in heaven you're living in you know the
40:26
world the world of Tears the veil of tears and and then you get to the New
40:31
Testament and you find out okay that's not all there ish there is going to be Heaven There is
40:38
salvation and the Old Testament suddenly makes sense it all fits
40:45
together that took a while to get to but I eventually got there yeah you look at
40:50
the Old Testament through the lens of the New Testament yeah that's what I do now yeah yeah
40:58
yeah so okay maybe it's time to switch gears again and discuss so something that came up in the last video is we
41:04
made a little side comment about Catholics and uh and I said oh Catholics
41:10
man Catholics right right and uh it was actually it wasn't just in like we weren't trying to make fun of Catholics
41:16
at all it was you talking about the the Friars right the franciscans right but
41:21
the question that I have related to this is so when you became Christian would you say that you became like you
41:28
embraced Mere Christianity and then you started to look at the different denominations and were trying to
41:34
delineate which one is the correct denomination to join and in the car ride you were saying that Catholicism is one
41:39
of the ones that you actually attempted to to join first well I I to be honest with you I grew up in New York City okay
41:47
uh there were um New York City native New Yorkers are either Catholic or
41:53
Jewish or atheist okay now there are Protestants in Manhattan but I grew up in Brooklyn and the Protestant the white
42:00
Protestants were just rich people I never met uh so I didn't know them uh so
42:05
I never knew an actual white Protestant you know and and until I was in college
42:11
I think I never considered protestantism I didn't know anything about it to me Christianity was Catholic yeah and uh at
42:19
some point I was actually living in Italy and um lucky you yeah it was nice
42:25
10 years and uh I um it was around the
42:30
time that I came to Faith uh and I I um tried to join the I
42:37
I went to the Catholic church and there was a uh priest who gave me instruction he spoke
42:42
English and uh I I said I'm ready to be baptized and uh it never
42:49
happened uh it did it didn't get through the higher authorities um then I came to
42:56
the US for very complicated reasons for reasons which are too complex they were basically bureaucratic having to do with
43:02
my past life I've had a very complex and somewhat stormy life SE
43:08
I've been married three times and so this had to do with some of that and uh
43:14
then I came to the US and tried again I went to another
43:19
long session in Pittsburg Cathedral where I I was living in Pittsburgh and
43:24
and uh got trained and then I was told that I had to deal with some again some
43:31
issues in past life which I could not deal with so I gave up on being baptized I
43:37
thought well that there's nothing I can do it's not going to happen and uh and as I say in my book and I'll repeat what
43:44
you said I have nothing but respect and admiration for Catholicism I don't have
43:50
that feeling for the bureaucracy of the church I I pray that the church will
43:55
someday deal with that issue along with some others but the essence of Christ of
44:01
Catholicism I I have no argument with MH but I decided I really did want to be
44:08
baptized and I I understood the importance of baptism and so I decided Well okay I'll go to a Protestant Church
44:15
I'd never been in one and I went to a Methodist Church by
44:20
chance uh the story is I I thought I would become a presbyterian because I
44:25
knew Francis Collins was a Presbyterian so I actually went to his church cuz I was living you know at that
44:32
point I was working at NIH uh and I I went to his church but it was so crowded
44:37
there was no parking space so I couldn't stop so I went to the next Church which
44:44
was a Methodist Church and there was parking there I walked in I listened to this
44:51
incredible sermon which just grabbed me and I went back to the next
44:58
Sunday and again beautiful sermon about love it's just it's just wonderful and
45:04
um I went over to the preacher to the pastor later after the service and I
45:10
told told my story and the response was would you like to
45:17
be baptized next Sunday wow and I said what is that possible I mean don't I
45:23
need you know don't I need an indoctrinate a of course whatever no no you have the
45:29
spirit you have the Holy Spirit with you it's clear so come next Sunday you'll be
45:35
baptized and that's what happened I think this story is going to resonate with our Protestant audience the
45:41
Catholic audience might be a little bit upset at hearing the the whole bureaucratic issue well they may be
45:48
upset but they're lucky because they you know they either they they came from a
45:54
Catholic Family or they married someone who was Catholic they didn't have the kind of background I had yeah yeah my
46:00
background was tough uh so there's just no hope for you to join the Catholic church I haven't found any that may oh
46:07
that would be different now I'm already baptized oh okay so since I'm baptized I think that will not be a problem I'm not
46:14
sure I'm not sure I'd have to talk to a priest about that okay but I have also
46:20
lost my interest I'm perfectly happy in the Methodist Church I don't blame you uh I've risen
46:27
from being baptized five years later I became the lay leader in not no not five
46:32
years two years later do you do you teach it all I have done I've given some courses uh in the church within the
46:38
church sure what do you teach on well it's an interesting story you know I I also learned a lot about other
46:45
Christians uh I thought well you know the Catholics already accept evolution
46:50
at least at the top but I didn't know about Protestants so I after I joined the pastor asked me if I would give a
46:57
class on science and evolution and I said okay I'll try to explain what it is I thought maybe 10 or 10 people might
47:05
show up and there was 60 people came and I started out by saying okay uh how many
47:11
people here uh believe that evolution is basically
47:16
true and I thought maybe one or two people would raise their hand I think it was 58 people raised their hand 58 out
47:23
of 6 58 out of 60 the two who didn't uh i l
47:29
convinced so that was a wakeup call I said well wait a minute what's going on here I thought Protestants you know
47:35
right well no it turns out the majority of Protestants totally accept mainstream
47:40
science you know the I mean the young Earth creationism which by the way I I
47:46
am not strongly opposed to Young Earth creationism I don't think it's correct MH but I have no argument I have very
47:54
good friends who are scientists and young Earth creationists and we work together on various things that are well
48:00
you're about to meet another one at the conference yes I know Marcus Ross exactly and he's excellent he's so good
48:06
yeah and and you know they have some good arguments uh it turns out that I think most of those arguments are
48:12
refutable MH and I'm sure Michael will refute them but because he's not a he's not a
48:20
degreed scientist but he knows a lot of science yeah yeah so um but I don't have
48:26
any argument with them theologically because they're interpreting the Bible
48:31
in a way which I don't agree with but it's legitimate and I I I don't think anyone
48:39
has the right to say no you're wrong about the Bible if you're a Believer if you understand that Christ Rose and and
48:47
from the dead and is our Salvation you're a Believer and you want to interpret the Old Testament differently
48:54
okay it doesn't hurt me uh you're a Christian I'm a Christian as
48:59
long as we both agree on that I don't care
49:04
uh I'm not out to prze for a scientific Viewpoint that's not my job it's not my
49:13
interest but you know having said all that I I found out that young Earth
49:19
creationism is actually derives originally from Seventh day
49:24
adventism and then was EV eventually absorbed into the Southern Baptist convention in the' 60s after the uh the
49:33
book The Genesis Flood came out Henry Morris it's not it's not the original
49:38
interpretation of scripture at all it's a brand new 19th century interpretation
49:44
originally from George price mccre there's so much of that around in Protestant churches yeah and and and
49:50
yeah and and many Protestant churches not just Baptists but many and many
49:55
churchgoers hold to you know that particular interpret by it's not a l literal
50:01
interpretation when whenever you hear someone say I believe literally in the word is written no they don't nobody
50:08
does but they're interpreting Genesis in a way that is different the way I interpret it uh I interpret Genesis as
50:16
being very supportive of The evolutionary theory but that's a whole subject we can't get into yeah well
50:22
maybe we will maybe I mean this is just one of many interviews hopefully
50:28
so hopefully next time we'll we'll be against but it actually might be time to wrap up the interview is there anything
50:34
that we haven't discussed so far that you would like to touch on before we close it out well I I think the closing
50:42
will be similar to what my closing last time and and and that is that I had to struggle not just to reach
50:49
Faith but once I reached faith I had to struggle a little bit with
50:55
many questions to start with what about okay what about the Bible what
51:00
about you know Christian whatever evil whatever um and I I I met every one of
51:09
those struggles and came through it to the point where in many cases the result
51:16
of that struggle was an enhancement a strengthening of my new Newfound
51:21
Faith so what I should probably end with is this
51:27
doubt is not the opposite of Faith doubt is part of
51:33
Faith doubt is the opposite of certainty okay and uncertainty is scientifically
51:41
valid the uncertainty principle is a fundamental Bedrock of physics and it's fine to be uncertain
51:49
and it's fine to doubt when you have a doubt and we all do I do you do everything every one does
51:58
when you have a doubt don't throw it away don't put it aside don't bury it under a rock explore
52:05
it because God is real and God is good and God will guide you through that doubt and show you the
52:12
answer it doesn't matter what the doubt is it could be the hor horrendous problem of
52:18
evil which we didn't talk about but I have a whole chapter devoted to that and
52:25
um it's a hard question it doesn't have an answer and it's worthy it it's
52:31
worthwhile to have doubts about God because of
52:36
evil but if you explore that enough you won't find the answer of why
52:43
God allows evil but you will find that God is real
52:48
anyway I without it's hard to go into detail how explain why that's true but I
52:53
feel that very strongly so don't worry about having doubts don't
52:59
suppress them bring them up and this is one of the roles of apologetics you know
53:05
go to an apolog go to someone who is an apologist who knows apologetics go to a
53:10
theologian ask those questions read the answers you know NT Wright has books on
53:18
this which are CS Lewis books so many people have uh least stroble you know
53:25
has books which will address those doubts and will help
53:32
you and even if they not totally answered they're answered
53:37
enough and have faith that all of those questions and all of those doubts will
53:44
eventually be answered for you for me probably sooner than most of the rest of
53:49
you but they will be answered because that's what salvation
53:55
means to reach the answer
