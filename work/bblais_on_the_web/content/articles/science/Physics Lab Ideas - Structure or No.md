Over the years I have taught introductory physics labs and I have seen that most “canned” labs offer very little to the student in the form of learning.  I summarize them as “here is something known quite well, and you are going to measure it badly”.  Labs measuring the acceleration due to gravity, $g$, falls into that category.  How do you improve these sorts of labs?  I have a few ideas.

1. choose problems where the answer isn’t known or known well
2. push the limit of a particular simple case into the area where the simple case breaks down
3. have the students design the lab themselves to answer a question

So, for the case of the acceleration due to gravity, put it as a model comparison problem:

* Model 1 = objects fall with a constant *speed*
* Model 2 = objects fall with a constant *acceleration*

Then you give objects to the students such as pennies, packing peanuts, coffee filters, marbles, etc…  Some objects might be best explained with Model 2 while others with Model 1.  Neither model may describe some perfectly.  How can you tell?  Having the students design the resulting tests makes the laboratory experience a lot more interesting.  I’ll add a selfish note that it makes the labs more interesting _for the instructor_ as well.
