I learned a somewhat disturbing fact about sea squirts recently - once they find their permanent home [they eat their own brain][1] because they don’t need it anymore - their brain becomes a resource-heavy extraneous organ.  Yikes!  The article continues to explore the idea of how “Our body and mind are tightly connected. The body is an important part of the learning process.”, a concept which is not stressed enough.
