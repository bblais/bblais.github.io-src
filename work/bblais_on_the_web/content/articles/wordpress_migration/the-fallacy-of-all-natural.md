I was[reading an article][] about the anti-vaccine movement, encouraging
pro-vaccine supporters to be more vocal - something I support
whole-heartedly.  In the article there was an awesome quote, that really
needs to be driven home whenever any of the anti-vaxers spout the
benefits of all-natural solutions to problems.  I typically point out
that cobra venom is all-natural, but would not recommend ingesting it.
 This quote, however, points out the all-natural effects of not
vaccination in a particularly powerful way:

> However, while there is nothing more "natural" than large numbers of
> children dying in a Malthusian cesspool of unchecked contagious
> disease, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that we should avoid
> that. This shouldn't be a controversial opinion.
