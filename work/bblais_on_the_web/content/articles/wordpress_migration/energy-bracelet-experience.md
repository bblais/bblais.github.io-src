I’ve spoken before about the energy balance bracelets and how they don’t
work. I just had an experience at a local flower show where I ran into a
vendor of the bracelets. He enthusiastically invited me to a
demonstration, exactly like the demos I’d seen before. He was even
cooperative when I asked to do the demonstration on him. When I
proceeded to knock him over while he was wearing the bracelet (he
claimed that I was pushing outward) and failed to knock him over when he
wasn’t (he claimed I was pushing inward), he didn’t look too happy. When
I pointed out that that was how it worked, he started trying to quote
studies, and I amiably walked away.

I am not sure what the best thing to do with these people. I thought
about doing what Richard Saunders does, and wear 10 of them (buying them
in bulk) and handing them out with a demonstration. That might get me
thrown out. Someone suggested I contact the media, a month or so ahead
of time for the flower show, and get them to do an investigative piece.
Another thing I may do is, if they are willing, is to suggest a very
simple blinded experiments. The nice thing about the balance bracelets
is that they claim some very simple, reproducible effects. As a result,
it is pretty easy to test it in the confines of a vendor booth at a
flower show. I will need to come prepared with two identical little
bags, and a fake bracelet, in order to do the test. Also, if they claim
improved balance, it’d be nice to have a balance test where the the
seller is not involved...something like a balance beam, perhaps. I feel
confident that I can be a real pain, yet not involve lawyers, in a case
like this.
