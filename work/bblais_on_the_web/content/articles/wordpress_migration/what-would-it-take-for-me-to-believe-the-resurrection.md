So in a [comment on a previous post][], I am asked

> “what sort of evidence would convince you of, let’s say, the
> resurrection of Jesus?”

I want to break this up into two separate questions, because it will put
into context my perspectives on historical evidence.

### What would it take for me to believe that there was a *modern* resurrection? {#whatwouldittakeformetobelievethattherewasamodernresurrection}

Take a case of a [Nigerian Pastor][] resurrected in 2001 after being
dead for 3 days following a severe car accident. Sounds about as good as
it gets, as far as evidence. Certainly way more evidence than we have
for Jesus - many more “witnesses”, documentation of medical examination,
many more recent accounts, etc… There are some skeptical accounts
[here][] and also [here][1]. This is the first I’ve heard of it. Am I
convinced? Nope. Why not?

-   the fact that there is a definite possibility of motive for fraud
    and/or exaggeration
-   the fact that the events occur in a culture riddled with
    superstitious thinking
-   the fact that the events take place in a region without the proper
    diagnostic technology
-   the story contains elements such as a transfer to a smaller, lesser
    equipped hospital where the patient knew the doctors when - given
    the supposed severity of the accident- the nearby, bigger hospital
    would be the logical choice

Each of these raises the level of suspicion. What I am criticizing here
is that the claims are being made and investigated by possibly credulous
individuals, who have something to gain, and do not make the proper
steps to rule out fraud, exaggeration, mistakes, etc… When I look at an
extraordinary claim, I want these. To convince me it would take

-   a group of unrelated individuals backing up the claims…
-   …applying strict skeptical methods, …
-   …with nothing or little to gain, …
-   …and a history of honesty

I would want to see confirmation from people who have something to
*lose* in agreeing to it, either a significant departure from their
professed beliefs, or something similar. Pretty much I’m asking for
something similar to the [JREF prize][], although it need not be that
particular organization.

Is this *too* skeptical? I don’t think so. I hold this same level of
skepticism for scientific claims, two examples I outline in [a previous
post][]. To shamelessly quote myself,

> “If the evidence is not enough to convince a reasonable skeptic, then
> we can’t be particularly confident in it.”

This is especially the case with extraordinary claims.

### What would it take for me to believe that there was an *ancient* resurrection? {#whatwouldittakeformetobelievethattherewasanancientresurrection}

Given this, could I ever be made to believe in an ancient resurrection?
Probably not. Not because I am closed to it, but the kinds of methods
and evidence that I would need to convince me of a modern resurrection
just didn’t exist 2000 years ago. Four accounts (five if you count
Paul), that demonstrate mutual copying, and don’t even claim to be
eyewitnesses is hardly convincing for even more meagre claims than
miraculous resurrections.

Christians, do you believe every miracle claim? If not, what criteria do
you use? If the same amount of evidence for Jesus’ resurrection existed
today (i.e. a handful of 2nd and 3rd hand reports, no physical evidence,
and no skeptical inquiry), would you be convinced? I would wager that
not a single honest Christian would accept this, or else they’d have to
accept a million other miracle claims from other faiths, and be so
credulous as to not be functional.
