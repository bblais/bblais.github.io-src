Title: The Role of Humanity into the Future

Yet again, IBM is creating AI to best humans in a task that has been,
perhaps, a symbol of uniquely human activity: Jeopardy! The system,
Watson, is [doing quite well][] against the humans. The number of
applications for this technology is nearly endless.

I’d wonder how this success will play into the broader discourse on the
human intellect, and our view of ourselves on the universe. When [Deep
Blue defeated Kasparov][], and the computer became (unofficially) the
world chess champion, I remember having mixed feelings. We like our
icons, I suppose, and hate to get rid of them. It’s like growing up, and
losing Santa Claus, perhaps. The history of science has been to deflate
human arrogance, and yet successes like Deep Blue and Watson are not
quite the same because it is our own ingenuity which created them.

On some level, Watson *feels* like a different accomplishment than Deep
Blue. Chess is deterministic, well formulated, and complex. It’s
complexity is the only thing that challenges an easy computer solution,
which was accomplished finally by brute force: get enough fast hardware
attacking a well-described problem and you win....always. Watson isn’t
nearly as well defined as chess, or at least it doesn’t *appear* to be
as well defined.

[Watching Watson][], there is a creepy sort of feeling, probably due to
too many evil AI movies (2001, Terminator, Matrix, etc...). Kids growing
up today will have this sort of technology as the norm. All-in-all, an
interesting series of events to keep watching!
