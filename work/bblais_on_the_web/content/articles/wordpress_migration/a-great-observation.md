So [this post][] from Laura Wattenberg's "Baby Name Wizard" blog has a
wonderful observation:  

> Here's a little pet peeve of mine: nothing rhymes with orange. You've
> heard that before, right? Orange is famous for its rhymelessness.
> There's even a comic strip called "Rhymes with Orange." Fine then, let
> me ask you something. What the heck rhymes with purple?
>
> </p>
> If you stop and think about it, you'll find that English is jam-packed
> with rhymeless common words. What rhymes with empty, or olive, or
> silver, or circle? You can even find plenty of one-syllable words like
> wolf, bulb, and beige. Yet orange somehow became notorious for its
> rhymelessness, with the curious result that people now assume its
> status is unique.

I was directed to the quote by Andrew Gelman's [Statistical Modeling
