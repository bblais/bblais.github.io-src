For anyone interested in statistical inference or probability, you
should check out my new book (released under the Creative Commons
license).  You can download it here:

There is a software package, written in Python, for doing the
computational examples but this is not needed to read the book.

Let me know what you think!  This is an ongoing process, with a number
of additions in the works, but I wanted to put it out there to get
feedback and to make it a bit more official.
