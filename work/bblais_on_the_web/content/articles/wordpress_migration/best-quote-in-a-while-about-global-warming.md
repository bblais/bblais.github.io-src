In the article [Sixteen Concerned Scientists: No Need to Panic About
Global Warming][], physicist Ivar Giaever is quotes the American
Physical Society policy on global warming: 'The evidence is
incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions
are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth's physical and
ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely
to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now.'

His next quote is priceless and dead on:

"In the APS it is OK to discuss whether the mass of the proton changes
over time and how a multi-universe behaves, but the evidence of global
warming is incontrovertible?"
