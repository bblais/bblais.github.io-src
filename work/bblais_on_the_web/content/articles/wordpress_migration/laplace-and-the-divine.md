In a [previous post][] I used the word "God" in quotes, when referring
to Laplace's view of determinism. This was done because Laplace himself
did not believe in God, and I used the term as a convenience to
represent a hypothetical all-knowing being. The clearest view of
Laplace's perspective comes from an interaction with Napoleon. After
reading Laplace's Mécanique céleste, Napoleon asked him about the lack
of the reference to God anywhere in the work. Laplace responded that he
had no need for that hypothesis.

In a strict way, this is an agnostic perspective. The description of the
universe, as described by Laplace, does not need to use the concept of
God in any way. This does not disprove the existence of God, or even
deny God's existence. It merely states that the concept of God is not
needed. This is the pure vision of science, and why science does not
necessarily conflict with religion. However, there could be certain
claims from specific religions that conflict with science. The 6000 year
old Earth, part of some fundamentalist Christian beliefs, is one
example. The God as the mystery in the Universe is not something that
can conflict with science.
