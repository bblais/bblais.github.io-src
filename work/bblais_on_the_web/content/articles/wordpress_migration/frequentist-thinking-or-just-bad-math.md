Title: Frequentist thinking, or just bad math?

In Steven Pinker's excellent book "How the Mind Works", he describes how
people are bad at probability assessments, but are much better at
frequency assessments (pg 348). It almost comes out and says that the
brain is frequentist and not Bayesian, and it certainly implies it. He
outlines how badly people do on the classic rare disease problem:
"frequency of a disease is 0.01%, you take a test that is 99.99%
accurate (false positives at 0.01%), you test positive. What is your
chance of having the disease". People, even educated people (even in the
medical fields) get this one wrong a lot.

Pinker contrasts this with "Think of 10,000 people, so we expect 1 to be
infected and 9,999 to be not infected. You take the test, and the 1
person infected will almost certainly test positive, and we expect 1
person out of the 9,999 to test positive as well. We know that you
tested positive, so what is your chance of having the disease?"

He claims that people are much better at getting the answer right. In my
view, this is less about being good at calculating frequencies, and more
about being bad at math. The second way of describing the problem pretty
much sets up and carries out all of the "difficult" math, and then
rounds so that all you have are small integer values. People do much
better with that. If you want an example, not in probability, you can
read my paper on["Teaching Energy Balance using Round Numbers: A
Quantitative Approach to the Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming"][],
which was motivated by the Weight Watchers system.

In the weight watchers system, counting calories (215+340+...) is
replaced by dividing by 50 and rounding (4+7+...). Same result, but
small numbers are easier to work with.
