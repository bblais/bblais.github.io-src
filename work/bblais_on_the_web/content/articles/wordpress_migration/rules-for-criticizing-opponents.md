Below is an excerpt from [Dan Dennett's article][] article "tools for
thinking".  I heard an [interview with him on Point of Inquiry][], which
I would say was just "ok".  I wanted to hear more about the tools, and
too much of the interview time was spent talking about free will and
consciousness.

I like these rules, in theory, and perhaps I should try practicing them
more strictly to see if they are valuable in practice.  I think the
context might matter.  In a debate, with limited time, it might not
work.  It may also not work well if you suspect that your opponent is
going to quote-mine the heck out of your response.  However, it may be a
good attitude to develop, and keep one from falling into closed-minded
arrogance.  Even if one doesn't *communicate* this directly, forcing
yourself to itemize points of agreement is probably a good thing, and it
is always a good idea to be able to communicate ones opponents position
with fidelity.

A quick survey of responses of people who don't like Dan Dennett claim
that he isn't putting these words to good use himself, although I think
he probably comes closer than the other "horsemen" (i.e. Dawkins,
Harris, Hitchens).

Thoughts?
