There are some that argue that religion should be eliminated because of
all of the harm it does, such as the suicide bombings, honor killings,
the Inquisition, etc... This includes the “New Atheists”, like Sam
Harris and Richard Dawkins. Others counter that this one-sided
perspective ignores all of the good that religion does, such as support
for people when they are ill, the donations to natural disaster funds,
etc... They argue that religion does more good than harm. This sort of
argument is used in economics, and is similar (although not identical
to) a cost-benefit analysis. One can focus on, for example, the harm
that cars bring in pollution and pavement like environmentalists do or
one can focus on the benefits of cars like the access to better health
care, the allowance of critical population densities to support
significant industries like the industry reps would do. An economist
would then weigh both sides, benefits minus costs, and see which to
prefer.

In order to do this with religion one cannot simply take the good of
religion subtract the bad, come up with a positive number, and say that
religion is a benefit to society. It’s like saying that the treatment
for the measles is two aspirin and some juice resulting in more cases of
recovery than death and saying that we shouldn’t replace this treatment
with something else. As is turns out, for the measles, a vaccine will
prevent nearly all contractions of the disease, and virtually all
deaths.

If we replace religion with a rational perspective (as Sam Harris
proposes), which includes a respect for spiritual experiences but not
the supernatural explanations of them, then it may be that we
essentially vaccinate people against such behavior as suicide bombings,
honor killings and inquisitions.
