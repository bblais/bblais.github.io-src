In this discussion/debate, I talk with Travis Dickinson about the concept of faith.  Travis is the author of "Stand Firm: Apologetics and the Brilliance of the Gospel" and says that both Christians and atheists often adopt a faulty definition of faith. He makes the case that faith is less about beliefs, and more about ventured trust on the basis of evidence.

I make the case that the term *faith* is poorly defined, and if it means the same as *trust* then we should just use that word. I speak about probability theory as the structure of epistemology, and stress scientific thinking.
