### Description of Episode
* Full Title: *How did life begin? Adam Rutherford & Fuz Rana - Unbelievable? - 09 April 2013 -- Origin of life debate - Adam Rutherford & Fuz Rana*
    > 
> Was the emergence of the first self-replicating organism a result of design or the blind forces of nature?
> Adam Rutherford is an atheist scientist whose new book "Creation: The Origin of Life" claims to show a naturalistic explanation for how life arose. Fazale (Fuz) Rana is a biochemist with Reasons To Believe (and a speaker atUnbelievable? The Conference 2013). He values scientific research into origins but believes that Rutherford's explanation is a dead-end. Design is still the best explanation.
> The first of two programmes dealing with cellular biology. Next week they discuss "Creating life in the lab".

### Notes
    
Fuz - *"We should relax methodological naturalism to allow supernatural explanations."*{.tq}  This is not *[God of the Gaps]*, there is evidence of design. {.theist}

I'd like to know why we need to introduce supernatural explanations to explain the design, when we can first introduce *natural* design explanations.  What would be an example of this?  *Alien* design!  You might not think I'm serious, but clearly even this unlikely explanation is more likely than a supernatural explanation, because we know life *can* exist in this universe, that there *are* many planets other than ours and that the material for life *exists* off of our planet - all of which have strong evidence.  We don't have *any* evidence for the supernatural, and I would add I doubt one could.  Even so, the natural explanation is more likely, so one has to wonder why these design theorists never seem to bring it up?  Could this be showing their religious agenda, perhaps? {.me}

Adam - Supernatural "explanations" raise more question than they answer.  Dead-ends in science shouldn't be taken as a problem it is just the process of science - it is how science progresses.  {.atheist}

Fuz - But we're exhausting all of the explanations, so we should put the *design* hypothesis on the table. {.theist}

This is like the theory of superconductivity, back in the 1950s, or the theory of spectroscopy, back in the late 1800s.  Many of the smartest people on the planet had exhausted, what to them appeared to be, all of the available explanations...for decades.  Running out of options, for the moment, is not an excuse to bring in the supernatural.  Essentially, when you do that, is it no better than saying *magic did it!* {.me}
