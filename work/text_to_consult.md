    Hello Heather!  Hope you had a nice break.  How does your semester look?  It's a new year and I'm trying something a little different.  If you or anyone you know would like help on a science stats or programming project, I'd love to help.  I'm not expecting anything in return other than the opportunity to learn new things and to apply my skills help to colleagues.  You can check out some of my work on my website, https://bblais.github.io/.  If you're interested in stats, you might like the textbook I wrote (and provide for free) on intro stats: https://bblais.github.io/posts/2019/Jan/14/stats-for-everyone/.  If you'd like a newsletter from me periodically, sign up at the website.  

    Thanks and hope you're doing well!

    Hello Nina!  Sorry to hear about the canceled Mars conference.  I certainly hope this shutdown gets solved soon - so many people affected!

    Hello Ruth!

    We met briefly at Goldschmidt last summer.  Hope your work is going well.  I was just in London for the first time this past week for family vacation and enjoyed it immensely.  We got lucky with good weather - or perhaps the rumors of a rainy London are exaggerated?
