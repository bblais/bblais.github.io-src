- had read studies demonstrating the negative effect of grades on our natural curiosity and our desire to take intellectual risks. - What studies
- Grades interfere with our intrinsic motivation and perpetuate the idea that school is a place for competition rather than discovery.
- the importance of failure. In order to figure out a problem or truly understand a concept, we need to play with possibilities, make mistakes, receive productive feedback, and try again.1 Grading systems demonize failure rather than uphold it as a critical aspect of building new knowledge.
- Rates of anxiety, depression, and even suicidal ideation have spiked dramatically, and academic stress tied to grades is a leading cause of this escalation.
    - How do we know itsvabout grades

- grades bear a resemblance to that ubiquitous symbol in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel The Scarlet Letter.
- Like the townspeople in the novel, our educational systems use grades to mark students, to label them in ways that have lasting negative effects.
- The image also brings with it notions of punishment and marginalization and shame, particularly for anyone who is not a white man.
- Distinguishing between evaluation and assessment is the key, then, and the difference comes down to those old classics intent and effect.
       - Funny   i was thinking the opposite direction   what is the students intent in the work and what is the efffect
- We can use this same logic to think about grades. Is the intent of giving the mark married to the effect on the student?
- But evaluation implies measurement and measurement implies objectivity, and—as we will see in chapter 1—grades are not objective measurements.
- When grades are used for assessment, on the other hand, it means that their primary role is to communicate feedback. We give feedback to help students grow and make progress.
- very few students are ever asked to reflect on their learning or on the feedback provided by their instructors in these kinds of models.
- It is also worth noting that we have never entirely moved away from this philosophy of ranking in our schools and colleges. Naming a valedictorian and conferring Latin honors (cum laude, etc.) are both legacies of grading’s original sin.
- A–F grading system was not embraced because teachers all agreed it was the best way to measure learning. It was simply thought to be an easy, standardized way for educational institutions to communicate with each other about student performance.
- Horace Mann.
- Before he died in 1859, Mann—from his home base of Massachusetts—had engineered many of the features that now define public education in America, from the tax structure that provides for local school districts to the creation of school libraries to an emphasis on continual professional development for teachers and so much more.
           
           - What is wrong with them
- He also thought standardized tests were a good idea, so I don’t want to give you the impression that everything he did was a home run.
- I really cannot overstate how revolutionary it was to move to a system where grades were envisioned as a way to provide information about an individual student’s performance rather than as a tool used exclusively for comparing students to each other.
- We care because grades serve as gatekeepers to the many possible futures our children and young adults wish to pursue.
- We care because grades operate as a currency in education, and this system is rife with inequities. We care because grades are wielded as weapons and rewards. We care because grades dominate every aspect of a student’s academic life.
- When winning is a viable possibility, it is easy to run toward the reward of victory rather than focusing on our individual fitness gains. If you are like me and winning is never an option, then it becomes possible to enjoy the scenery and simply try to do better than the last time.
- Whereas a race has a clear winner, the “prize” of a good grade is actually a mirage. Nobody wins anything when they get a good grade. Instead, the finish line just moves back a bit further, and students are forced to run the same course over and over
- Grades distract from, instead of enhancing or accurately measuring, this learning.
 -Students become what Ken Bain and others have called “strategic learners,” and they do only what they have to do to get the grade they need to move to the next test,
- Your Highlight on page 22 | Location 328-329 | Added on Sunday, November 10, 2024 - We want kids, teens, and young adults to learn for the sake of learning or because they are intrigued by a subject, not because they feel as if they are required to do so.
- when we are intrinsically motivated we are driven from within and for no expected reward other than our own enjoyment and betterment.
- Whereas extrinsic motivators are useful as incentives to get things done, intrinsic motivation is vital when we are concerned about the quality of a product, process, or performance.
- Feedback, not grades, is the driver of intrinsic motivation, since it is nonthreatening and typically focused on individual improvement.
- Grades interrupt that cycle at every step. First, they penalize the trying. Trying something new is not an easy thing to do. It requires some degree of vulnerability, a willingness to take intellectual risks, and a level of comfort with not getting something right on the first attempt. Students are often graded on the tries, though. They are often not given much chance to practice in low-stakes, non-evaluative settings. So they learn to toe the line, to stay in their comfort zone, and not to risk too much because of the consequences for doing so.
- Our grading systems do not typically make possible the kind of trial and error that is necessary for learning.
- Trying something new is not an easy thing to do. It requires some degree of vulnerability, a willingness to take intellectual risks, and a level of comfort with not getting something right on the first attempt.
- Grades also stigmatize failure, which is a catalyst for learning and is the expected result of trying something new for the first time.
- Failure is regarded as something to be avoided entirely in academic work and students who fail are often cordoned off for remediation.
- In a 2014 paper, Corbin Campbell and Alberto Cabrera found evidence that there may not be a clear connection between grades and learning. Specifically, they conclude that “deep learning is

- I doubt this
- this disconnect between learning and GPA also potentially means that someone could get a low grade but could still have learned deeply.
-  “Applying pressure in the form of control is the single most damaging thing parents and teachers can do to their children’s learning.”5 Parental pressure can heighten a child’s perception that grades are more important than learning, and it sends a signal, sometimes overtly, sometimes more subtly, that love and respect are somehow contingent on performance in the classroom.
- To be clear, I am not suggesting that we abandon academic standards or that all tasks and assignments that lead to difficulty are evil. We learn from making mistakes and getting feedback on those errors, so miscues, frustration, even confusion are all important parts of developing a richer understanding of a subject.

- No thats not true
- Suffice to say that a grading model using a bell curve as its statistical and philosophical foundation is inequitable from the outset because it takes as its starting point the faulty notion that some students by virtue of their biology will always fall below average on the curve.18


- Agree
- When grading curves are used, not only are these students disadvantaged by their prior educational experiences, but now they are in direct competition with students from backgrounds where they have benefited from more resources. The sort of competition fueled by curves eliminates any incentive for collaboration or study groups or any other mutually beneficial strategies to improve.19 This only serves to widen the gaps and piles inequities on top of each other.
- Supporting a child who is trying to navigate an educational system that privileges grades and achievement begins, simply, with compassion and love.
- recalibrate the role of grades in their lives is for us to stop talking about them so much.
- Talk about literally anything else related to school instead. What interesting fact did they learn in biology today? Who is their favorite teacher and why? How are their friends? How did soccer practice go? What are they reading in English class? What is the Pythagorean theorem anyway?
- teach them how to effectively manage their stress levels.
- manage their stress productively include: Getting enough sleep Exercising Talking to adults about the cause of the stress Balancing playtime and downtime Enjoying nature Writing about the stress Using mindfulness approaches The APA also offers some guidance for what parents themselves can do to help their kids regulate their stress levels: Be positive models for managing our own stress Build their confidence by letting them solve some problems on their own Teach kids how to use media, especially social media, safely and in a healthy way Give them the tools to resist negative thinking
- cultivate their curiosity.
- Grading takes up a lot of an instructor’s personal and professional time, and it forces teachers into the role of judge and evaluator, when many of us went into the profession in order to help students and to serve as mentors.
        - Mentor is also judge
      
- Determining the difference between an 82 and an 88 on a high school history paper is a lot more challenging, and more subjective, than many people realize.
- There were no grades listed, only marks indicating if he had exceeded a standard, met a standard, or still had some work to do to meet a standard.
         - That is a grade   a is exceed   b c met d f not met

- Doesnt scale  with redos   can it be done without redo?  just feedback?
- First, she stopped giving grades on individual assignments, opting instead to provide written feedback only. Gradually, she began to ask students to co-create the curriculum with her and to complete a lot of reflection assignments. By late 2014, she had taken grades out of the equation as much as possible. She still needed to report grades at the end of each marking period, but those grades were proposed by the students themselves using evidence from their work. Sackstein always reserved the right to have the final say, moving grades up or down in extreme cases, but the process was largely driven by students.
- That was also the year he created a Facebook page called “Teachers Going Gradeless,” or TG2 as it is now commonly known.
- define this sort of standard as “a clear and observable action that a learner can take to demonstrate their learning of some important topic or concept.”13
- students have multiple attempts to meet the standards and, usually, multiple means by which they can demonstrate their understanding. In order to allow for multiple attempts, instructors create a process for students to keep trying if they do not meet the standard right away, often through revising their work or taking other versions of quizzes and exams.
- student achieves proficiency right away, then the standard probably has not been pitched at the right level. The same is true if students are struggling to meet standards. Instead, students should make gains throughout the term and meet the standard at their own pace as the course unfolds.
- students would receive an A if they completed 15 of the assignments for the course, a B if they completed 12, a C if they completed 9, and so forth. Instructors give feedback on the assignments and make a qualitative judgment as to whether the students’ work has met the assignment goals, but the grade itself is one based solely on the number of assignments completed.
- It is called contract grading, because early versions asked students to commit to an assessment plan they wanted to pursue by signing a statement, or the syllabus, or some other document, almost like a contract. This practice is no longer widely used, but the name remains.
- Adopting a contract grading model requires instructors to clear several intellectual hurdles. First, they have to believe that students will significantly advance their understanding of the subject simply by completing an assignment at a satisfactory level. Then, once instructors have made this philosophical leap, they must commit to designing assignments and activities that will allow for this depth of learning to take place. That is not an easy thing to do; it takes time and a dedication to frequent revisions.
- The kind of contract both Elbow and Danielewicz use in their first-year composition courses guarantees students a B as long as they complete the minimum requirements related to attendance, participation, deadlines, and revisions. Students can score above a B if their writing is deemed “to be of exceptionally high quality.”19 That final point seems to me to run counter to the general philosophy of contract grading, because it introduces more subjectivity to the model than other forms, but it does respond to any critics who might suggest that writing instructors who use models like these are abandoning efforts to enhance the quality
- Asao Inoue has developed the concept of labor-based contract grading for composition courses.
- students can get an A for doing more labor—additional assignments or revisions—rather than for more polished or effective prose.
- the B as the guaranteed grade
- Starr Sackstein and Arthur Chiaravalli both eventually landed on a model that combined a lot of instructor feedback with multiple opportunities for students to reflect on their work and a process for students to propose their own grades at the end of a marking period or semester. This final grade is typically determined through a conference between the teacher and the student, with instructors reserving the right to change a student’s proposed grade if it is too far off base or the student has not provided enough evidence to justify the proposal.
- sometimes called ungrading and sometimes called collaborative grading,
- “ungrading” is often deployed not only to describe this grading model, but some people also use it as a synonym for the entire concept of alternative grading strategies more generally.
- However, it does seem to me to be a much better fit as a descriptor for the philosophy of challenging grades, of questioning the hold of traditional grades, of seeking to upturn the business-as-usual methods that reign supreme in most schools, rather than as a word that describes the grading model we have been discussing.
- Courtney Sobers, an associate teaching professor of chemistry at Rutgers
- While we do not yet have a lot of quantitative research demonstrating that collaborative grading leads to a greater depth of understanding and higher levels of achievement for students, we do have data showing that such models can enhance student autonomy, motivation, core beliefs, and dispositions about learning.
- Joe Feldman, in his book Grading for Equity, suggests a grading model that uses only 0 through 4 as the markers of progress. He argues that this scale is more evenhanded since there are fewer gradations and only one way to indicate failure (the zero) rather than 59 different ways to fail in the 0–100 scheme.28
- Just because there are no grades does not mean that there are no academic standards.
