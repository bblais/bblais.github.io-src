I was a judge for a local science fair this past week, and found a number of projects lacking.  After thinking about it for a while, I realized that one of the problems seems to be the distinction (or, rather, lack of distinction) made between *demos* and *experiments*.  In teaching science, especially in the younger grades, it seems common to say something like *"today we are going to do an experiment, mixing baking soda and vinegar"*.  This, to me, is not an *experiment*.  So, what do I think is the difference?  Here are a few thoughts.  Are there any more?

1. The outcome of an experiment is *unknown*, whereas the outcome of a *demo* is *known* - deliberately.
2. In an experiments, the variables are *quantifiable*, whereas the variables of a *demo* are typically discrete and not quantitfiable.  
3. In an experiment, the outcomes are also *quantifiable*. 

To continue with the example, the following *demos* would be bad science fair topics:

* what happens when we mix baking soda and vinegar?
* which produces more gas, baking soda and vinegar or baking power and vinegar?

To make them true experiments, we could ask

* how does the amount of gas produced with baking soda and vinegar depend on the quantity of baking soda?  (both the amount of baking soda and the amount of gas are quantifiable)
* to follow up, how does the amount of gas produced with baking *powder* and vinegar depend on the quantity of baking *powder*?  Is this the same as the dependence on baking *soda*?

So how many of the "experiments" shown in, for example, [this science fair site] are actual experiments?  The first few I checked did not meet the criteria above for experiment, but one could possibly modify them to do so.  However, without this guidance, the students are left with a sterile view of science.
