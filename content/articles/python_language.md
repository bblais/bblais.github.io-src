title: Why Python is the language everyone should learn
Date: 2014-12-15

I have been a fan of the [Python programming language] for many years.  It was encouraging to me lately that there are two articles about Python, reiterating many of my experiences, and teaching me some things I was unaware of.  The first, about [myths about Python] and its use in large-scale applications, was a real eye-opener.  I've never had to scale my apps up, or have high security, so I had implicitly bought into the two myths that Python was not suited for the job.  Nice to know I was wrong!

The other, about someone's [programming journey away from C and Java to Python], mirrored [my own experience] somewhat.  For me, it was coming off of Matlab, and finding that I could do all of what Matlab offered and much more.  At one time, I rewrote Matlab, Perl, Sed, Awk, and Jed scripts all in Python - being able to think in one language as opposed to five was a huge boon to productivity.

In my experience, Python is the easiest language for a beginner to learn, and it is one of the most powerful languages I've ever worked with.  I've been able to get a few of my colleagues hooked on Python over the years, and have yet to find a problem for which it is not well suited.  Even this website is written in Python!
