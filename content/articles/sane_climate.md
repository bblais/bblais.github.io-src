One of the standard climate blogs I read is [Judith Curry's blog Climate Etc...]  I find that the topics she brings up, and the points she adds to it, are always very engaging and even-handed, without the usual alarmism.  For example, here is a [summary of Bjorn Lomborg's Senate testimony], all points perfectly reasonable, as far as I can see.

From his estimates, "The cost of inaction by the end of the century is equivalent to an annual loss of GDP growth on the order of 0.02%....equivalent to losing one yearâ€™s growth, or a moderate, one year recession." while "policy action as opposed to inaction, also has costs, and will still incur a significant part of the climate damage." and incur (optimistically) a cost of "1.5% of GDP by the end of the century." 

Further, he addresses certain specific policies, like

> Solar   and   wind   power   was   subsidized   by   \$60   billion   in   2012,  
> despite   their     paltry   climate   benefit   of   \$1.4   billion.   
> Essentially,   $58.6   billion   were   wasted.   Depending   on   political   
> viewpoint,   that   money   could   have   been   used   to   get   better   
> health   care,   more   teachers,   better   roads,   or   lower   taxes.   
> Moreover, forcing   everyone   to   buy   more   expensive,   less   reliable   
> energy   pushes   higher   costs   throughout   the   economy,   leaving   less   
> for   welfare.

I find, nearly universally, that people who espouse strong environmental policies never look at the *benefits* of *not doing* those policies - they focus entirely on one side of the economics.  

Finally, I like the metaphor that he brought in
    
> The   metaphor   here   is   the   computer   in   the   1950s.   We   did   
> not   obtain   better   computers   by   mass producing   them   to   get   
> cheaper   vacuum   tubes.   We   did   not   provide   heavy   subsidies   so   
> that   every   Westerner   could   have   one   in   their   home   in   1960.   
> Nor   did   we   tax   alternatives   like   typewriters.   The   breakthroughs   
> were   achieved   by   a   dramatic   ramping   up   of   R&D,   leading   to   
> multiple   innovations,   which   enabled   companies   like   IBM   and   
> Apple   to   eventually   produce   computers   that   consumers   wanted   to   
> buy.  

This seems to me to be a rational way to discuss these topics.
