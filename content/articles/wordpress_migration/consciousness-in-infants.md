I've always been interested in the origin of consciousness, and am
intrigued by attempts to quantify it and to detect it.  A[recent article
in Science][] seems to address part of the origin of consciousness in
infants.  It makes you wonder what infant experience is like, and
perhaps the semi-conscious experience of dogs, cats, octopi, and
dolphins.  The abstract is:

> Infants have a sophisticated behavioral and cognitive repertoire
> suggestive of a capacity for conscious reflection. Yet, demonstrating
> conscious access in infants remains challenging, mainly because they
> cannot report their thoughts. Here, to circumvent this problem, we
> studied whether an electrophysiological signature
> of consciousness found in adults, corresponding to a late nonlinear
> cortical response [\~300 milliseconds (ms)] to brief pictures, already
> exists in infants. We recorded event-related potentials while 5-, 12-,
> and 15-month-old infants (*N* = 80) viewed masked faces at various
> levels of visibility. In all age groups, we found a late slow wave
> showing a nonlinear profile at the expected perceptual thresholds.
> However, this late component shifted from a weak and delayed response
> in 5-month-olds (starting around 900 ms) to a more sustained and
> faster response in older infants (around 750 ms). These results reveal
> that the brain mechanisms underlying the threshold for conscious
> perception are already present in infancy but undergo a slow
> acceleration during development.
