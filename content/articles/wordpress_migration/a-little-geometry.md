Title: A Little Geometry

I've just finished the book "Euclid's Window" by Leonard Mlodinow, and
really enjoyed it. The book describe the history of geometry from
Euclid, Descartes, Gauss, and Einsten. During his coverage of Euclid he
presents a simple proof of the Pythagorean Theorem that really resonated
with me. I don't recall ever seeing a proof of it, or at least no
memorable proof. This one uses a minimum of jargon and formality...you
just draw the picture, discuss it for a bit, and you see it!

You start with a right triangle, like:

[![]][]and you make two constructions, from a square with sides a+b.
The first construction looks like:

[![1]][]which, by eye, you can see that the total area of the square
is the area of 4 triangles (just like our original) plus the area of the
inner square, which is c\*c (which reminds me that I have to figure out
how to do superscripts and subscripts in this blog. :) )

The second construction is nearly the same as the first, and looks like:

[![2]][]which, again by eye (with a little shading to make it a bit
more obvious), the total area of the square is the area of 4 triangles
(just like our original) plus the area of the two inner squares, which
are a\*a and b\*b. Therefore:

a\*a+b\*b=c\*c

for any triangle for which you can make this construction, which are
right triangles.

Really neat!
