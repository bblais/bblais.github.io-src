I was just introduced to a very creative project called the [Symphony of
Science][]. It uses a technology called [Autotune][], traditionally used
to keep lousy pop singers in key. In real-time it adjusts the pitch of
the singer, so what comes out of the speakers is the correct frequency.
Technically, it's very challenging to modify the waveform consistently,
and in real-time.

Anyway, this particular project takes famous scientists, and puts their
speech to music. The music is catchy, and really captures well the
philosophies of [Carl Sagan and others][]. It just makes me realize how
much I miss Carl Sagan, which then makes me miss [Stephen Jay Gould][]
and [E.T. Jaynes][].
