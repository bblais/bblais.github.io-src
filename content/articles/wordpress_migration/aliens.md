Here is an interesting attempt to make the Drake equation more
accessible:

I like the fact that they have the various standard assumptions, from
optimistic to skeptical.  I've always erred on the side of the
optimistic on this one.  It just strikes me as just one more example of
human arrogance to conclude that we are special in this galaxy.  One
thing I've always liked about the Drake Equation is that it focusses the
discussion.  It takes a totally impossible question ("how many
intelligent civilizations are there in the galaxy") and breaks it up
into a number of smaller questions, many of which are answerable.  Of
course, near the end of the calculation it gets a little dicey, but so
are all such problems.
