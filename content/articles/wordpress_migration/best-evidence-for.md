In preparing for a talk on Science and Religion, I came upon this
somewhat amusing example.  I did a google search for "Best evidence
for..."  and filled in one of the following 3 things:

1.  the Big Bang
2.  Evolution
3.  God

I then took the very first link to compare.  The results were:

1.  the Big Bang
    - <http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html>
2.  Evolution
    - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_common_descent>
3.  God
    - <http://www.gradresources.org/worldview_articles/evidence_for_god.shtml>

What is interesting is that in the first two cases there is a very long
list of evidence, direct observations, measurements, etc... In the last
case there are philosophical arguments.  The differences in the amount,
quality, and type of evidence shown in these sources I think is
particularly telling.  When you ask for evidence for the existence of
something, and you get philosophical arguments, then I think you can
immediately dismiss the claim.  I would also claim (and someone tell me
if there is a counter example please!) that there is not a single
example of the existence of an actual thing being first or best
established from a philosophical argument.
