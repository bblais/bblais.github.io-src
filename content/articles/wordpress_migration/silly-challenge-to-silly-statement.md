Title: Silly challenge to silly statement

There is a new [Challenge to Global Warming Skeptics][] by the
FiveThirtyEight statisticians, who did such a good job with the
Obama-McCain forecasts. The challenge is summed up by:

> "For each day that the high temperature in your hometown is at least 1
> degree Fahrenheit above average, as listed by Weather Underground, you
> owe me \$25. For each day that it is at least 1 degree Fahrenheit
> below average, I owe you \$25."

He's trying to address recent statements by some conservatives,
paraphrased as "It's cold this summer here in Minneapolis, so global
warming must be wrong." That's a bit of a strawman, but from the [Power
Line blog post][], there really is this sense of local vs global
perspective.

Well, it's actually a pretty silly challenge to a pretty silly
statement. No serious GW skeptic I've heard contests that their **is**
warming on a global scale, but argues against the magnitude or, more
commonly, the cause of the warming (human vs not). The statistical
challenge here only addresses whether there is warming, and even there
is rigged to win **even if there were no real global warming**, because
of the urban heat island effect. Most of the thermometers started out in
rural areas, or in fields outside of towns, and cities were built around
them. Areas around pavement are warmer than the surrounding areas, so
there would be a measured warming trend due to development, not due to
atmospherics.

A better bet would involve predicting the global temperature for, say, 5
years from now (along with the uncertainty). Each side puts in their
prediction, and pays \$1 times the ratio of the posterior probabilities
for the two models, P(M~1~)/P(M~2~). Would anyone take a bet like that?
