Title: Language of Science

One of the things that I noticed, starting as an undergraduate and
moving into graduate school, is that scientists have a peculiar sort of
conservative language. They'll say things like, "it's possible that such
and such", or "it's likely that such and such" but rarely (if ever) say
"such and such is true". [In a previous post][]I said that a proposed
solution to the faster than light neutrinos was likely to be true, but
left open the possibility that the error will probably be found
elsewhere. As solid as relativity is, scientists will still never say
that relativity is "true", only that is it very well established,
confirmed, supported, etc... In any other context, something with as
much support as, say, the theory of relativity or the theory of
evolution or the germ theory of disease would simple be called "fact".
In science, calling something like that a fact is both wrong (it can
still be modified!) and dangerous (it stops all inquiry!).

Paraphrasing the words of Sam Harris, pretending to know things that you
do not know, or claiming certainty for things for which there is not
evidence to support it, is a huge liability in science...and should be a
liability in other contexts as well (think religion, politics, etc...)
