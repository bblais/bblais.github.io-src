Title: A walk down memory lane

I just found a page on ["How to Find a Formula for a Set of Numbers"][].
 It's a cool little procedure for taking a series, like:

2, 8, 9, 11, 20

and producing a polynomial to give you the next ones in the series,
like:

<span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><span>*﻿n*</span><span>^*3*^</span><span></span><span>*-
17/2 n*</span><span>^*2*^</span><span></span><span>*+ 49/2 n -
15*</span></span>

<span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><span style="font-family:mceinline;">where
n is the term number, starting from n=1.  Try it out!  Anyway, it was a
method I learned in high school math league, and thought it was so cool
I wrote a BASIC program on the old TRS-80 computers to do it.  I had
forgotten how to do it, and it was fun to see it again.  I particularly
liked the comment on the page:</span></span>

<span style="font-family:Helvetica;"><span style="font-family:mceinline;">

"""If someone gives you the sequence, say, "1, 4, 9, 16", you could run
them through the above process and get the answer that the person is
probably looking for: the rule is n^2^ so the next value is 25. But you
could also invent *any* number as the next number in the sequence, say
42, and come up with a rule for "1, 4, 9, 16, 42". Feel free to work it
out. It comes out to:

 

> 17/24 n^4^ - 85/12 n^3^ + 619/24 n^2^ - 425/12 n + 17

<span style="font-family:Times;">and the next term is then 121.</span>

So if you want to be obnoxious, the next time you are given a quiz of
"find the next number in the series" problems, just pick any number you
like and fill it in, and you'll be completely correct. You'll probably
get a failing grade on the test, but you can enjoy the smug satisfaction
of knowing you were right."""

I knew a kid who, because of a ridiculous fluke, had to redo some of his
middle-school competency tests in high school.  So, when presented with
a series like 2,4,6,8,... he did this on a test (and yes he did fail the
test and have to redo it).  He was also shown a number of clocks, and
asked what time does this show, and for all of the answers put "analog
time".
