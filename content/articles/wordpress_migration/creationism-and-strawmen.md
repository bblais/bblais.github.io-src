I can’t tell you how much I cringe when I hear people say, “I just can’t
imagine how we developed our complexity through random chance” and
similar things, referring (incorrectly) to the “random” process of
evolution. This is a strawman argument that is put forward: either total
random chance or God. Creationists often do this, but it is also done on
the other side.

Take, for example, a recent post I saw on Facebook from one of my
friends:

> ...poses a direct challenge to all creationists. Provide an
> explanation for vestigial features of living organisms without
> inadvertently proving evolution.

He was surprised to learn that Answers in Genesis, the go-to place for
all things creationist, had a position on [vestigial features][]. That
description made use of arguments from molecular biology, and so-called
microevolution. It seems as if it is a common misunderstanding that
creationists reject all of the apparatus of evolution and microbiology,
and a simple, strawman statements like “creationists reject evolution”
don’t hold.

It really does help to look at the *best*arguments from each side, to
really see the limits of the analysis. Going back and forth between
[Talk Origins][] and [Answers in Genesis][] is a good way to explore the
arguments. For example, in transitional fossils we [look in Answers in
Genesis][] and find articles like [this one][] and [this one][1] which
steep of arguments from authority, claims without evidence, and
cherry-picking. Many of the arguments rest on criticizing small details
on a small number of fossils. In the [talk origins article on
transitional fossils][], we get a very detailed, and seemingly complete,
list of transitions from all major animal types. It comes in many parts,
and details the characteristics on each transition.

Try it yourself! Pick a topic, go through and find the best arguments
each has. It’s a very good exercise. Throw in a good dash of the
[baloney detection kit][], and you’re on your way.
