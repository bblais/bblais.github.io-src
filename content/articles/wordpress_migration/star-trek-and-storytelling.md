I'm a big fan of Star Trek. I grew up with it (on re-runs), followed the
Next Generation and Deep Space Nine with interest. I did skip Voyager
and Enterprise, but definitely follow the recent reboot movies.

Although I still enjoy the storytelling of Star Trek, I do have a
problem with it that creeps into other shows as well. I noticed it again
in the most recent movie. Because Star Trek is a franchise, almost by
definition, none of the characters can actually die or change in any
substantive way. Because of this, from a storytelling perspective,
dramatic scenes are a lot less dramatic.

One way to see this also is to imagine spinning out possibly story
lines, given only the pilot episode. If you did this for, say, Star Trek
the Next Generation you would probably hit a few of episodes even as
late as season 7. If, however, you tried to do it with Babylon 5 you
wouldn't even make it to late season 2. Perhaps this is the story
telling equivalent of market failures with monopolies.

I enjoyed the new Star Trek movie (especially in 3D!), but I sometimes
wish that this lingering constraint on the show were lifted. Imagine,
for example, a series set in the Star Trek universe where the characters
actually change? Where there isn't a technological solution to every
problem? Where the outcome wasn't really known in advance?
