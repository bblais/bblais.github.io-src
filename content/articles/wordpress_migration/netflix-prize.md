Fortune magazine had a [recent article][] on the Netflix prize. A very
interesting competition to increase their correct recommendation
percentage by 10%. I was struck by a comment at the bottom by a reader
of the article:

> If it is true what the article says, that the BellKor team’s
> algorithms used information such as "genre" and "actors", then they
> plainly cheated!  
> This information was not available in the contest. The contest data
> had only 4 pieces of information: people ID, movie, date, and the
> rating values.  
> If BellKor managed to get extra information about the people and
> movies, it is hard to understand how NetFlix overlooked it. Therefore
> I'm quite sure that the article got the story wrong – it is too
> extreme to be believable. But if the article is right, then the
> winning team used crooked means to get the prize and its 'solution'
> does not worth much. Hope it is the first option…

I remember looking at the data, and if I recall correctly, I remember a
script to add to the database from IMDB. I assume this was allowed,
because otherwise there would have been no way to get 10%.
