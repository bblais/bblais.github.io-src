For any that are interested, I've given or been part of a [number of
presentations recently][]. Two of particular interest were done today
for Research and Engagement Day (REDay) at Bryant University.  The first
on [science and faith][], and the other on the [mathematics of the
zombie apocalypse][] [with [a handout][]].  Enjoy!
