So it seems as if the Iraqi police are [dowsing for bombs and
firearms][], as covered in the [New York Times][] and [James Randi][].
They are doing this using a device they've purchased to the tune of \$80
million, and it works no better [using a coat hanger][]!

I think the best quote which summarizes the danger and the bad thinking
is:

> Major General Jehad al-Jabiri is head of the Ministry of the
> Interior’s General Directorate for Combating Explosives. “I don’t care
> about Sandia or the Department of Justice or any of them,” he says.
> “Whether it’s magic or scientific, what I care about is it detects
> bombs.”

Of course, if it hasn't been shown to detect bombs by science, the other
option is irrelevant.
