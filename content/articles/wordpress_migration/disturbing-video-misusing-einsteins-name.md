I saw this video posted on facebook The link to one rebuttal, which
links to the original, is here:

I wrote as a comment to the person posting it:

> Actually, this is not a true story, nor does it capture even in the
> slightest way the views of Einstein on religion (see
> http://www.einsteinandreligion.com/).
>
> Although it is a cute video, there are logical flaws such as the fact
> that neither "hot" nor "cold" exists except as labels on
> "temperature", neither label with any special role.
>
> I'm mostly disturbed by the fact that this Christian organization is
> trying to legitimize a flawed argument, by falsely attributing it to a
> very famous non-Christian, and nearly non-religious, scientist.
