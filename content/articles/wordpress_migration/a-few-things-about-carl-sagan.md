It's Carl Sagan day, so it is worth to pause for a moment to remember
his contributions.  I remember being motivated by him, and his Cosmos
series.  He always had a way with words, describing the essence of
science, apart from all of the details that distract us.  In some ways I
wish I were more like him, and able to make such a contribution to the
world. 

So, in memory of Carl, here are a few links to enjoy:
