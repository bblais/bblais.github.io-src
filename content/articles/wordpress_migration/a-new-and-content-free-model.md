In his article ["A New and Effective Climate Model"][], Stephen Wilde
(guest posting on Anthony Watts' blog) states his dissatisfaction with
current climate models, and proposes another "model" for climate which
he hopes will improve the state of climate modeling in general. In the
article he has items like:

1.  Solar surface turbulence increases causing an expansion of the
    Earthâ€™s atmosphere.
2.  Resistance to outgoing longwave radiation reduces, energy is lost to
    space faster.
3.  The stratosphere cools. Possibly also the number of chemical
    reactions in the upper atmosphere increases due to the increased
    solar effects with faster destruction of ozone.
4.  The tropopause rises.
5.  etc...

This list continues for 26 points, not an equation in the mix. So why am
I so hooked on equations? Take the first item, and call "Solar surface
turbulence" T, and the size of the atmosphere, A. Saying T goes up, so A
goes up, could be like:

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>
which would predict a nice linear response. What about this:

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>
or this?

</div>
Each of these is a translation of "when T goes up, A goes up", but they
have radically different forms, and they have radically different
effects. You can't build a proper scientific model in words alone. Words
are not precise, and there are many different ways to translate them
into something that is precise, that can actually make meaningful
predictions.

A model of just words is not really a model, in the scientific sense.
Lord Kelvin said it best:

> "In physical science the first essential step in the direction of
> learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and
> practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it. I
> often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and
> express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you
> cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your
> knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the
> beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely in your thoughts
> advanced to the state of Science, whatever the matter may be."
