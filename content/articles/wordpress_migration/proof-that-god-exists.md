Introduction
------------

If you want some entertainment in the form of logical gymnastics, go to
[this page on the proof of god][]. If you're impatient, here is one of
the arguments:

Do you believe that Absolute Truth exists? Possible answers…

1.  yes -\> you go on to the next piece
2.  no -\> is it absolutely true that absolute truth doesn't exist?

    1.  yes -\> then you actually believe that absolute truth exists!
    2.  no -\> you get asked again if you believe that Absolute Truth
        exists (with the statement "This is not a glitch (Think about
        it)". - essentially implying either that you're making an
        absolute truth statement, or you can't state anything.

     

3.  You don't know -\> Is this absolutely true?

    1.  yes
    2.  no -\> you get asked again if you believe that Absolute Truth
        exists (with the statement "This is not a glitch (Think about
        it)". - essentially implying either that you're making an
        absolute truth statement, or you can't state anything.

     

4.  You don't care -\> send you out of the site.

A similar point is made about the laws of logic:

\> "If you believe that laws of logic do not exist, how do you make
decisions about the most basic things in life? How do you decide which
side of the road to drive on? How do you choose whether to drink water
or poison for nourishment? \> \> One interesting aspect of denying laws
of logic, like the law of non-contradiction, is that since you DO NOT
believe in laws of logic, you actually DO believe in laws of logic. If
contradictions are allowed in your worldview then so is that one."

Why this is stupid
------------------

I think the first basic flaw in this line of argument is that it assumes
that all statements are yes/no statements. There is no accounting for
probability, uncertainty, etc… Does "Absolute Truth" exist? I don't
know? Is it absolutely true that I don't know? I don't know!

The second basic flaw is that it may not be a well-defined question.
What does "absolute" really mean? What about "truth"? We have working
definitions, which might be a bit sloppy, but perhaps if we understood
them better we'd find that they are not well defined concepts. An
analogy in physics might be the word "particle". We have a working
definition, and in most cases it is very usable, but we know that
fundamentally we just have energy and interactions - the particle is a
convenient construct.

Finally, I don't think I have any patience for arguments which don't
even make an attempt to be grounded in some empiricism.
