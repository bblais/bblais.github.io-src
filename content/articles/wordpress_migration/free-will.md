Title: Free will

After a discussion with a friend about Nostradamus, I realized that the
existence of prophets conflicts with the idea of free will: if the
future is written in such a way that we can make definite predictions
years ahead of time, then the choices of people can mean nothing...they
are thus not free. Perhaps this is true, but I find it interesting that
Christianity (and probably other religions) has free will as a basic
axiom, and yet prophets are a common and fill an important component of
the faith!
