It all started with "information is beautiful", with this [post about
the 2012 non-issue][], and then it went to [this interesting figure
which I am pondering][]...not sure if the labels are correct. Finally I
was pointed to infochimps, [a collection of data which I need to look at
more closely][].

We are in the information age, and I'd love the way the information in
the first two links is portrayed, and I plan on playing in the
infochimps site more.
