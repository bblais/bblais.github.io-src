When I hear things like this (taken from the [Catechism of the Catholic
Church][], but could well be from any Christian Church):

> The Trinity is One. We do not confess three Gods, but one God in three
> persons, the "consubstantial Trinity".83 The divine persons do not
> share the one divinity among themselves but each of them is God whole
> and entire: "The Father is that which the Son is, the Son that which
> the Father is, the Father and the Son that which the Holy Spirit is,
> i.e. by nature one God."84 In the words of the Fourth Lateran Council
> (1215), "Each of the persons is that supreme reality, viz., the divine
> substance, essence or nature."85
>
> 254 The divine persons are really distinct from one another. "God is
> one but not solitary."86 "Father", "Son", "Holy Spirit" are not simply
> names designating modalities of the divine being, for they are really
> distinct from one another: "He is not the Father who is the Son, nor
> is the Son he who is the Father, nor is the Holy Spirit he who is the
> Father or the Son."87 They are distinct from one another in their
> relations of origin: "It is the Father who generates, the Son who is
> begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds."88 The divine Unity is
> Triune.

This is what I hear:

\$latex  
a=b=c\\\\  
a\\neq b\\\\  
a\\neq c\\\\  
c\\neq b  
\$

And then when I hear a Christian say something like this, which was on
the Unbelievable facebook forum,

> We [...] stress the Trinity a lot, not only because we think it is
> true but because it explains some things.
>
> For one thing, it means that the ideas of personal relationship and
> love are built into existence and have always been. For another it
> helps us understand how God can be completely transcendent (the
> Father) and yet reveal Himself to us (via the Word and Spirit).

What I hear is:

Â 

> Not only do I think  
>  \$latex  
>  a=b=c\\\\  
>  a\\neq b\\\\  
>  a\\neq c\\\\  
>  c\\neq b  
>  \$  
>  is true, but it explains a number of things. For one thing, it means
> that  
>  \$latex  
>  a+x=b+x  
>  \$  
>  is built into the system. For another it helps us understand how  
>  \$latex  
>  a-x\\neq b-x  
>  \$  
>  and yet  
>  \$latex  
>  b-x=c-x  
>  \$

So where am I going wrong here? Where does the analogy break? If you say
that the Trinity is a "mystery", that is simply an admission that the
Trinity is incoherent. If you say that I am not using the word "is"
correctly, then please enlighten me as to the proper definition, but
make sure it is well defined.
