Here I summarize the (9 hour!) conversation that I was a part of here:  [Bad Apologetics Ep 20 - Miracles & even MORE even NEWER Resurrection evidence](https://youtu.be/FLCZFKNiEtg) where we respond to the  [Unbelievable? episode: Is there medical evidence for miracles? Craig Keener, Michael Shermer & Elijah Stephens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O3YZqFDxbs).   I want this post to be the place where I put as many of the specific miracle claims, the actual evidence presented, and some of the responses.  I wrote about some of these cases [in another post](https://bblais.github.io/posts/2020/Jul/09/skepticism-and-dubious-medical-procedures/)

The institution that is referenced for the work is [Global Medical Research Institute (GMRI)](https://www.globalmri.org/) and the documentary about miracles referenced is [Send Proof](https://www.sendproof.com).  

## Specific Miracle Claims:

- [Case Report of gastroparesis healing: 16 years of a chronic syndrome resolved after proximal intercessory prayer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229918313116)
- [Case report of instantaneous resolution of juvenile macular degeneration blindness after proximal intercessory prayer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550830720300926) - probably Marolyn Ford, but it can be hard to tell without the names on the papers.
- [Barbara Snyder (Barbara Cummiskey Snyder) – healed from multiple sclerosis](https://1c15.co.uk/barbara-snyder-barbara-cummiskey-snyder-healed-from-multiple-sclerosis/)
- [Chris Gunderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0QtFCpFg9I) who was born with an incurable disorder called Chronic Pseudo Obstruction Syndrome, which was cured by prayer
- [Bruce Van Natta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pqj2i9gb8U&t=1s) who had a truck fall on him, destroying much of his intestine, but shortly after prayer his intestine miraculously regrew.

## Fishing for positive outcomes

On GMRI's website there is the following request: 

> "We’re always looking for new testimonies. Do you have a testimony that is medically verified?”. 
 
Could you imagine a similar claim written about, say, a homeopathic remedy for cancer? *If you took our remedy, and improved, we want to hear from you. Otherwise, not.* Regardless of the contents of the specific studies, this sort of fishing for positive results is thoroughly unscientific and casts significant doubt on any results from this institution. 

## Case studies as the basis of evidence

The primary studies here are Case Studies, which are some of the *lowest* and *least informative* types of studies in medicine (see [https://guides.library.stonybrook.edu/evidence-based-medicine/levels_of_evidence](https://guides.library.stonybrook.edu/evidence-based-medicine/levels_of_evidence)) with Meta-studies, Systematic reviews, and Randomized Controlled Studies being the most effective forms. 

Case studies may be suggestive, but they are there so that you can propose hypotheses to test more rigorously.  No one in medicine evaluates the effectiveness of a treatment from case studies alone, or even primarily due to case studies.


## Base-rates

The entire approach of those arguing for miracles focuses on the (presumed) successes but in any real study for a treatment, we need to know all of the cases -- the ones that worked and the ones that didn't -- to provide evidence of efficacy.  Also we need to know what happens when there is no treatment as a control.  None of these steps are taken in any of these cases.

## Worldviews and Evidence

At time point 1:06:53 [here](https://youtu.be/FLCZFKNiEtg?t=4013) it's pointed out that even if miracles could be the case, regardless of your worldview, how would you be able to demonstrate that God did it?  Once you admit there are other agents, you need a process for actually determining that God -- as opposed to some other agent or natural process -- actually was the cause.

I also think that there is a two-stage process for investigating these and similar processes (i.e. aliens, homeopathy).  The James Randi foundation did this as well, with a preliminary test before the more in-depth test.  The point is to first establish that there is some interesting effect there, regardless of the cause, and only after passing that threshold do we get to consider a more in-depth investigation.

Also, the theists show a profound lack of imagination in coming up with studies that can test the involvement of an agent, while ruling out other effects.  James Fodor suggests, as an example, doing the prayer studies in different languages to help rule out some of the competing effects.  The fact that someone can come up with a simple idea like that, and none of the studies include these sorts of considerations, show that the theists aren't even trying to test their ideas.

## Physicians

At time point 1:47:35 [here](https://youtu.be/FLCZFKNiEtg?t=6463) Keener quotes a study that showed that half of the physicians studied said that they had seen what they consider to be miracles.  However studies also show about 80% of ER nurses and 64% of ER doctors believe lunar cycles affect patients' mental health, even though the data do not support such an effect.  There are any examples of this, so see https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15166467/ and https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/full-moon-does-not-affect-mental-health-emergency-room-study-suggests as a couple.


## Controls

At [time point 1:52:05](https://youtu.be/FLCZFKNiEtg?t=6725) [James Fodor] compares healing claims to homeopathy -- we have millions claiming an effect, and if we just counted those then we might be convinced that homeopathy was a real treatment.  What is missing are the controls -- how often does the "treatment" happen and there is no effect, and how often is there an effect but no treatment.  A comparison of base-rates is needed and Keener doesn't seem to care about this when it comes to miracles.  

## Timeline and a Face Palm

At [time point 1:56:59](https://youtu.be/FLCZFKNiEtg?t=7019) they outline a couple of cases.  James rightly points out that the most these people ever seem to provide is:

1. evidence that someone was sick at one time
2. evidence that they were not sick at a later time
3. sometime between those two points they claimed that they were prayed for (and don't always demonstrate that they actually were prayed)

The timeline definitely matters, especially if you're claiming a causal relationship.  I would add that most of these people are praying most of the time, so it's kind of like looking for astrological causes behind earthquakes -- since earthquakes happen all the time, you can always find one preceding or succeeding any other event you want.

How do we know the initial diagnosis was accurate?  


## Bruce Van Natta

[Time pojnt 1:59:25. ](https://youtu.be/FLCZFKNiEtg?t=7165)

- [Bruce Van Natta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pqj2i9gb8U&t=1s) who had a truck fall on him, destroying much of his intestine, but shortly after prayer his intestine miraculously regrew.

From the Send Proof film they admit that they can't publish Bruce Van Natta case because the accurate measurement of the length of intestine needed to verify the result *we don't have the technology yet*.  The current results are suggestive, but are not conclusive.  This means that the original measurements were not accurate enough to establish the lengths, and the follow-up that said it grew back are also not enough.

- they used xrays to diagnose it originally, which is not the best for soft tissue
- perhaps a thickening of the intestine would look like a regrowth?
- the natural explanation -- some natural healing plus the imaging being unreliable
- the secondary measurement said "approximately 6 feet" as opposed to 3ft, so the "approximately" is doing a lot of work
- perhaps under extreme damage there is more healing, but we haven't seen this in other cases because of the rarity of the effect

James:

> The trick is you have to dig a lot to get the actual facts of the matter, they don't typically present these to you like "here's the facts, and this is why we think it is a miracle" it's "the guy's intestine regrew" but that's not an established fact at all that's their interpretation of a certain set of facts.  It makes it very hard to investigate these claims because you have to spend so much time trying to work out what is actually established.

This is like the difference between theists asking skeptics to explain how the disciples ate fish with Jesus, when in reality what we have to explain is that we have a *text that has a story where*  the disciples ate fish with Jesus.  Taking the story as the evidence is problematic. 

# # Case Report of gastroparesis healing

[Time point 2:08:18](https://youtu.be/FLCZFKNiEtg?t=7698)

- [Case Report of gastroparesis healing: 16 years of a chronic syndrome resolved after proximal intercessory prayer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229918313116)

The story is that this person had a condition where they couldn't eat normally, were fed with a tube, and this persisted for 16 years.  Then he was prayed for and was instantly healed, could eat, and have his tubes removed.

An immediate thought is how many times was he prayed over and nothing happened?  This goes a long way of establishing (or not) a causal link. 

> ![[Pasted image 20220319082134.png]]

There's a long list of reasons for this poorly understood condition.  Also, this condition is known to come and go in some patients.  These are two red flags which will need some level of caution in establishing the cause of the condition improving.

The timeline of the events from the paper is

![[Pasted image 20220319081913.png]]

> ![[Pasted image 20220319083326.png]]

This explores some of the rarer causes, but more importantly, the study they reference for the viral cause for the condition had cases that resolved in as long as 2 years (N=11).

- perhaps this was the case here either with a longer resolving time (N=11 is not that large)? 
- or perhaps it resolved in 2 years, and they never checked for a long time, only checking right after the prayer 16 years later. 

This is the reason the specifics matter.  We know that the healing was *observed* after the prayer, but we don't know if it caused it because we can't rule out an earlier recovery that went unnoticed.  Even the [supplementary information](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0965229918313116-mmc1.docx) doesn't rule this out, where they have some reports in the 16 years but don't say they've been attempting oral feedings.  We also can't rule out that he was prayed for many many times in 16 years, and only at this particular time for some other reason he recovered.  It is for these sorts of problems that randomized controlled studies are developed and are necessary to distinguish effect from non-effect.

> ![[Pasted image 20220319083240.png]]

This would certainly be testable.  I think, however, there is a selection bias here -- those people who have theological reasons to expect healings are more likely to broadcast what they consider to be healing events, while others for the same sorts of events will prefer more modest interpretations.  Thus we will more often hear from the healing crowd.

[Time stamp 2:20:40](https://youtu.be/FLCZFKNiEtg?t=8440)

Craig Keener at around 37:00 in the Unbelievable? episode says 

> if i'm not mistaken the one that Herbert Benson conducted was that when they were trying to recruit people they were having trouble getting certain participants that all the protestant participants were from the unity school of christianity which actually doesn't believe in miracles and so you know they had a limit it's not the ideal way to conduct a prayer study

later, Keener continues,

> if there's a pattern like nine times out of ten where this happens it's in the context of prayer that that should say something again we we need a whole lot of a whole lot of cases to be able to to examine that

These are both testable, yet there seems to be little effort by theists to improve the studies, they seem to rather prefer falling back on case studies.  This shows a profound lack of imagination on the part of the investigators, and I think shows their hand.  They want the positive results and the authority that comes from the scientific enterprise, yet they aren't willing to put in the real work to earn that authority.

In Steven Novella's post at [Proximal Intercessory Prayer](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/proximal-intercessory-prayer/), he comments (on a different case, but applicable here),

>  But there is another reason to study “proximal” prayer, which in this study meant physical laying on of hands, not just being near the subject. Studies of distant intercessory prayer have been essentially negative – we see the typical random scatter of results expected of an ineffective treatment, with no consistent pattern of positive results, and with the best studies being negative. 
    
...and...    

> In my opinion this study represents a larger trend that I have discussed before – clinical research going backwards in quality after higher quality studies yield negative results. We have seen this with acupuncture – after well-controlled trials were negative, some proponents decided that “pragmatic” (i.e. unblinded) studies were better. We see this with homeopathy, where well-controlled studies are negative and then dismissed because treatments were not individualized.

The one-on-one treatments, when they show an effect, are confounded by the more intense experience, the one-on-one attention, the group pressures, etc...  You are adding a lot of psychological elements which make it harder to establish causation.

I misspoke in the episode for the next one, thinking the name was Barbara Snyder, but Barbara's case is an MS case.  I made a number of these errors in the episode, and I think it is because 1) the scientific papers (rightly) don't use names and 2) when the stories are told they don't cite their sources well and 3) I'm terrible with names.  Sorry!

##  Case report of instantaneous resolution of juvenile macular degeneration blindness after proximal intercessory prayer

[Time Stamp 2:37:40](https://youtu.be/FLCZFKNiEtg?t=9460)

- [Case report of instantaneous resolution of juvenile macular degeneration blindness after proximal intercessory prayer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550830720300926) - probably Marolyn Ford, but it can be hard to tell without the names on the papers.

The story is 

> an 18-year-old female lost the majority of her central vision over the course of three months in 1959 and was later diagnosed with juvenile macular degeneration (JMD).  In 1972, having been blind for over 12 years, the individual reportedly regained her vision instantaneously after receiving proximal-intercessory-prayer (PIP). Subsequent medical records document repeated substantial improvement.

There are many causes of this disorder.  

> ![[Pasted image 20220319091409.png]]

It was assumed that Stargardt's disease was the best fit for her symptoms, but she has no family history for this genetic condition.  Further, she also has a *twin* sister!  Since these diseases are genetic, it makes it *a lot less likely* that she had this condition.  

> ![[Pasted image 20220319091813.png]]


> ![[Pasted image 20220319095731.png]]

So her initial eyesight is 7/200, quite poor. 

> ![[Pasted image 20220319092256.png]]


The emotional language in the paper is a little unusual for a medical journal, and seems a bit sensationalist.  It also points to placebo as a possible contributor to the perceived magnitude of the improvement -- the amount of improvement is likely to be perceived to be higher given the expectation.  This doesn't affect the doctor reports, but the personal reports.  

The first doctor report is *two years after the event* (the event in 1972, the doctor visit in 1074)?  This seems really strange, if we are to believe the magnitude of the healing -- she claims to have gone from nearly blind to nearly perfect instantaneously, yet doesn't get this checked out immediately?  

The 1974 measurement is 20/100 compared to legally blind at 20/200 (uncorrected) which is still quite poor and far from being "restored", but still a large improvement from her measured 7/200 mentioned earlier.

We make a mistake in the episode here about corrected vs uncorrected vision measurements.  Honestly, this mistake is primarily due to sloppy reporting -- if you are reporting a set of numbers in a study, especially if you are establishing a timeline of events, you need to make it clear when some numbers are not comparable.  You don't mix, say, corrected and uncorrected measurements in a timeline unless you provide both at every time point you have.  To mix them makes it much harder to determine what's going on.  We don't have a real timeline on this case, so we can't tell where the causation is, when significant improvements have occurred, etc...

- perhaps a misdiagnosis of Stargardt's disease, and a gradual improvement for other reasons.  
	- because her twin didn't have it, it makes the original diagnosis questionable
	- the technology at the time is cited to be suboptimal in the paper
- we can't tie the prayer specifically to the timeline, because of expectation effects and placebo effects, so causation is in doubt 
- she had a genuine improvement, but we have to ask which is more plausible, that there was a misdiagnosis (with the extra point about the twin sister) or the miracle played out in that way

If this is the Marolyn Ford case, which I think it is, then we have to consider that she worked in a church for that amount of time, and obviously got prayed for many times with no effect, and only got the healing after many years.  I could just as well say that her brushing her teeth caused the healing, because she was healed in the evening shortly after she brushed her teeth.  Of course this is ludicrous, because teeth-brushing would occur twice a day, every day, so every single event would follow a teeth-brushing.  Prayer, in her house, probably occurs even more frequently.

> ![[Pasted image 20220319101541.png]]

it's hard to trust someone who says things like this, when we know that the measurement afterward was 20/100 -- far from perfect.  Of course, it's possible her sight was perfect and declined in the 2 years between the "healing" and the measurement which would call into question the miraculous nature.  It also highlights the need for detailed timelines to establish what the effect really is, before trying to grasp at causes.  

Kamil points out that there is a mismatch between the magnitude of the claim and the attention they pay to documenting it.  If you thought you were miraculously cured, you'd have it tested every two weeks not waiting two years.  There may be a difference between the way they look at things now vs the way they looked at it at the time of the event -- which is perfectly explainable under naturalism.  This effect has been seen a lot, but a good example is the [Rendelsham Forest UFO sighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendlesham_Forest_incident) where there is a big difference between the original reports and the later reports or the [Barney and Betty Hill case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_and_Betty_Hill) of alien abduction where one can track the contamination of the story to popular media depictions of aliens.

I think it also is evident that the theists aren't serious about studying these things, and are content to believe things on bad evidence. It's the same reason large careful studies aren't done -- they simply don't care enough, and are already believing, so why bother?

These two cases are some of the best they have, and they are only modestly interesting, and have plausible mundane explanations.  Even if we couldn't explain it, we'd say "this is interesting, maybe we should look into these effects more" -- this is what we do for any other proposed medical treatments when we have only two case studies to go on.  We wouldn't conclude that these things actually happened as reported, especially given the gaps in the timelines.  The fact that there are only two or three of these, that these are the best they have, given all of this time is damning evidence against their case that miracles actually occur at even the 1% level.  At over 2 billion Christians, praying many times, if this was a real effect at the 1% level we'd expect millions of documented cases yearly -- certainly a large enough signal to experimentally verify.  The fact that they can only produce two or three, with serious procedural and reporting issues, is strong evidence that this effect is non-existent.

## The stories change

[Time stamp 3:07:35](https://youtu.be/FLCZFKNiEtg?t=11255) We can see the stories changing in the telling, being simplified, critical details dropped.  This highlights many of the problems I've been talking about and we get to see it in real-time.



## Keener on Replicability

[Time stamp 3:11:11](https://youtu.be/FLCZFKNiEtg?t=11471)

>  i think michael's right about obviously so many things are coincidence so we have to weigh a lot of factors to see um you know is there a theistic context to it that that tends to predominate in in the cases where we have these and so on you need a lot of cases to be able to to test that but uh the issue that he raises about replicability is is a real issue in the sense that you know when when we speak of of god creating everything and we speak of you know as christians speak of god's handiwork being all around us you know that's that's those are things that can be tested for replicability but we may disagree on the explanation you know levels of causation but miracles as one-offs so to speak they're not replicable and so they're not really testable by replicable means you can't um you know ensure that you're going to have one the next time around at the same time there's all sorts of things we have to deal with that aren't replicable certainly in historiography i have to deal with that so we want to know how somebody died we can't kill them again to to to ensure that and that's why i brought up how in different different disciplines we have to use the epistemic approach that's suitable for that discipline and so for miracles i think a case study approach is much better




## Therapeutic effects of proximal intercessory prayer in rural Mozambique

- [Study of the therapeutic effects of proximal intercessory prayer (STEPP) on auditory and visual impairments in rural Mozambique](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20686441/)

A good response to this is found by Steven Novella at **[Proximal Intercessory Prayer](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/proximal-intercessory-prayer/)

>Let’s take the following hypothetical study: The study included 24 subjects who were all treated openly with the intervention in question. There was no blinding or control group – so everyone in the study, subjects and experimenters, knew that every subject was getting the treatment. The treatment involves active physical intervention with the subject. The protocol also calls for multiple interventions if initial treatments are not effective – essentially the subjects receive repeat treatments as long as possible until they report a response.
>    
> The outcome was either a change in vision or hearing. Subjects reported impaired vision or hearing at the beginning of the study and were tested with standard vision or audiology tests before and after treatment. All subjects demonstrated improvement from the intervention.
> 
> It should further be noted that the subjects in the study were not chosen from the random population but from a self-selected group that already believe in the efficacy of the treatment. Further, the authors admit, although they do not disclose the data, that previous attempts to document response to the treatment in other populations have failed.
>
> At this point anyone with any reasonable familiarity with how to assess the quality of medical studies should see that this is a worthless study. This barely qualifies as a pilot study. It really doesn’t matter what the treatment is or how plausible it is – you simply cannot draw any meaningful conclusion from 24 self-selected subjects with no controls and no blinding.
> 
>  Now, I know you can read headlines so you know this was a study of proximal intercessory prayer, but the point is – even if you assess the details of the study divorced from knowledge of what the intervention is, it should be obvious that this study tells us nothing.
    
Further...
