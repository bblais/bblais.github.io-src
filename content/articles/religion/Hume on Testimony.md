> That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavors to establish. (1748, pp. 115-16) - Hume

This statement by Hume gets apologists upset, because it seems to dispense with their entire line of evidence in a single line.  Timothy McGrew has [a video dissecting this statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Gv8Fw_fFE&list=WL&index=12) although much of it comes down to pointing out the obvious fact that likelihoods are necessary, and then downplaying priors.

Pretty much this statement by Hume is a direct consequence of Bayes Theorem, and thus quite hard to argue against. 

Using Bayes theorem we have (using the same notation as the [Extraordinary Claims post]({filename}../religion/Extraordinary claims and extraordinary evidence.md)

- $M_o$ - miracle explanation
- $M_1$ - mundane explanation, equivalent to "*not* $M_o$""
- $D$ - evidence of testimony

Similar to the extraordinary claims calculation.

$$
P(M_o|D)>0.5
$$
only if 

$$
\frac{P(M_o)P(D|M_o)}{P(M_1)P(D|M_1)}>1
$$
If we assume the miracle claim totally explains the testimony, $P(D|M_o)\sim 1$, then we have the necessary condition for the probability of the miracle,

$$
P(M_o) > P(D|M_1) P(M_1) = P(D \& M_1)
$$

This is such an elementary mathematical statement, it is independently arrived at by myself and others. Another treatment like this one is [John Earman's article in the Proceedings of the British Academy](https://sites.pitt.edu/~jearman/Earman2002a.pdf) for example.  "On this reading, Hume's maxim is the correct but unhelpful principle that no testimony is sufficient to establish the credibility of a miracle unless the testimony makes the miracle more likely than not."
