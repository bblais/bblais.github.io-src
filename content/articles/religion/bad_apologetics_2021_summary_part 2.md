## Eyewitnesses

[Time stamp 2:59:48](https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=10788)

 
> Kamil: this is actually one of the strongest reasons for me to doubt the eyewitness testimony behind the Gospels especially if you think that the Gospels were written in the genre of Greco-Roman historical biography.  [...] if you think that, then it's actually really, really unexpected that the authors of the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Matthew, for example, don't explicitly say they are based on eyewitness testimony.  Because eyewitness testimony was very highly valued in ancient historigrapphy and I find it consistently over and over again. When it's the case that the historian in question actually had eyewitness testimony available, that they were the eyewitnesses themselves or they had access to eyewitness testimony, they say that explicitly in the text.  It is actually very, very difficult to find instances where it's the case that they had access to eyewitnesses but they don't actually proactively disclose it. [...] I would absolutely expect Mark to say "this account is based on the memory of Apostle Peter". I would absolutely expect, for example, the Gospel of Matthew to say, I Matthew, The Apostle was called by Jesus or something like that because that's exactly what we observe over and over again in other historical accounts

This is an example of data which is expected on the hypothesis of eyewitness testimony, which is seemingly required for the McGrews to make any headway in their case to support the Resurrection.  This data is also simply not dealt with, or written off as an argument from silence (which it isn't).  

> Kamil:  So this is like a one piece of evidence that massively goes against the hypothesis of eyewitness testimony that actually, for me, the strength of that evidence is so overwhelming that it actually overcomes all of the early Christian attestation to the authorship





[Time stamp 3:06:57](https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=11217)

> James: We're about to get to looking at the the data that we're then going to compare explanations against . And what we'll see is that when they reject or argue against non resurrection explanations, they are happy to pick literally any detail from the gospels that suits their purpose. Very specific, very particular, minute sometimes detail. And the question would be, "Well, why should we accept that that is the case?" And it seems to me that we're going to have to go beyond a general reliability to get to that. We're going to actually have to go to like, basically, this was written not just by an eyewitness, but someone with a really good memory and got all of the details down. So by feeling free to appeal to all of these details, they're actually setting up a very high standard for themselves in terms of how confident can we be in these details. So to put it another way, it's very much not a minimal facts approach. We'll see the sort of details that they're appealing to and like it really does, then heavily rely on how reliable we think all of these details are. 


![[Pasted image 20220417200453.png]]

Here is the first of many examples where they argue against a claim by appealing to the fact that it is *intrinsically highly improbable* -- which is a prior, the part of the calculation that they are definitely not talking about with respect to theists claims.  As Bart Ehrman pointed out, it might be improbable -- but it is more probable than a miracle!



> Kamil: Yeah, but but it's always the case with minimal effects, right? Like you start by saying, this is just a list of minimal facts. And yes, that's true.  30 minutes later. It's no really, there were people who thought they saw Jesus eating a piece of fish in front of them. So how do you explain that a naturalism, right? They could not have hallucinated it because it was tactile and hallucinations are not like interpersonal and tactile. 

>Brian: I always find it telling that the list of minimal facts never seems to be an agreement from one apologist to another. 

> Kamil:  The swoon hypothesis is specifically aimed against Muslims, right? Because in the Koran, it says that Jesus didn't really die, but how they argue against it actually doesn't have any force against what the Muslims believe. Because in the Koran, it says that Jesus didn't die, but it looked like he did. So like Allah made it look like he died, which is obviously completely consistent with the historical account, right?

![[Pasted image 20220430132503.png]]

> Nathan: so when they compare the evidence, they say, how do we expect the evidence to look given "not the resurrection", right? Well, that would be exactly the same in that case because the evidence would look exactly the same, so it shouldn't do anything to that numerator denominator distinction. The ratio should just remain, but they don't do that.

And note again, that they criticize the swoon hypothesis because it is "intrinsically improbable", which is the prior they don't want to have to address on their own view 


[Time stamp 3:13:31](https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=11611)

> Nathan: They say one of the problems here for the skeptic who goes with this and I don't think any of us do go with the swoon theory. But he says, for example, you've got to "dismiss John's account of the spear wound as inauthentic". Well, that theory actually coheres with other details like, for example, the mistranslation of prophetic fulfillment.  It might be the case that they were reading the Septuagint to figure out what happened about Jesus life.  I think like that coheres quite nicely. 

![[Pasted image 20220430133210.png]]

> Nathan: they go on to talk about this John Dominic Crossan, something that his theory and then they say, you know, that his "radical position", well everything that they're saying is radically out of line with New Testament scholarship.  But it's again, just not the type of language that you really expect from an academic volume.

> James: Look, when *they*  say something, it's an "inference". It's an "argument". It's "based on evidence", "growing body of evidence" when *someone else* says it. Oh, it's just a "guess". It's a "mere extrapolation". It's a "radical position". It's just fluff. Like, there's no actual distinction here between what different people are doing. It's just whether they agree with that or they don't agree with that.


[Time stamp 3:22:23](https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=12143)

> Kamil: I'd also also like that there is no shortage of people who believe that a person was raised from the dead, even though that person has a known burial location that supposedly contains the body.  it demonstrates two things. First of all, that people who hold the belief that the person was raised are not interested in actually confirming that with physical evidence.  They don't  sneak up into the graveyard and dig up the grave to see if it has a body in it. Probably exactly for the reasons like if they were actually presented with the body they'd  probably dismiss it. And second of all, the other people who don't share that belief are not interested in debunking it by exhuming the person and showing the body  because it's more important for them not to disturb  the burial customs of the person than to debunk that specific claim.
> 
> You know, there is the famous Jewish rabbi (Menachem Mendel Schneerson) who claims to be a messiah. And apparently, they are still people who believe that he was resurrected, even though there is a zero empirical evidence for it. He actually has a known burial location. And also what's very important to realize is that even the people in the position of leadership in that specific sect of Judaism denied that claim. There were actual leaders who said, "no, he wasn't raised." But despite all of that, yeah, there are still adherents. 

This point, to me, shatters the entire apologetic edifice around the Resurrection.  To have a parallel case like this, where all of the boxes are checked for belief, with the only difference between this rabbi and Jesus is that we have fewer pieces of evidence concerning Jesus.  

> James: The point that I wanted to make with that example is though, that to say that" oh well, they must have had really good evidence, right? And their opponents mustn't, if anything, good to say, because if they did, then that would have dissuaded the people from from believing it." But we've just given a couple of examples. I cite a number more in my book about irrational belief persistence. There's so many cases of this that the claim that they would have stopped believing unless they had good evidence, there's just no reason for thinking that --  it's just assertion. There's so much evidence that that isn't the case. That's just not how people work in these contexts.

 > James: $W$ Is women's testimony, $D$ is for the disciples, which includes seeing and being willing to die and $P$ is for the conversion of Paul. So these are the three main facts that they wanting to put in their sort of Bayesian calculation, And they're going to say that these facts here are overwhelmingly more likely  under the resurrection hypothesis than other than not-resurrection hypothesis. So that's what the next few sections are going to be is going through each of these in turn. 
 > 
 > Brian: Make sure every time you see this, instead of saying, you know, the women who claim to have found the tomb empty or there were disciples who claim to have appearances of the resurrection,  say instead that that we have *texts* that say that there are women who claim to have found the empty tomb, that we have *texts* that say that there were post resurrection appearances of Jesus.  The data is not the claim itself, it's not the story,  it's the fact that we have a *text* that has the story.

![[Pasted image 20220526062929.png]]

> Nathan: But here's one point to focus on. So they're going to appeal a lot to consensus in New Testament scholarship. They're going to say, In a survey of recent New Testament scholarship, Gary Habemus has documented the interesting fact that a notable majority, approximately 75 percent of scholars writing on the subject during the thirty years from 1975 to 2005 agree that Jesus tomb was in fact found empty.

> James:  they have just been telling us at some length how unreliable the methods that most scholars who analyze this, like the critical scholars, the people that they don't like, right? So apparently, we shouldn't believe anything that they say -- we should discount them,  it's not really reliable. But now we're being told that the fact that most scholars, including this big group that we shouldn't listen to, think that something is true is a reason for believing it. They do this in other cases as well later on. Again, it's eating a cake and having it to. Look, if we disagree with them, they're unreliable.  But when they agree with us, we'll say, Oh, you know, this consensus of scholarship, you know, most scholars agree with us here.

> Kamil: Also, this statement is factually false. Habermas has published this  number in the literature, but he doesn't say that 75 percent of scholar agree that Jesus's empty tomb is a fact. What he says specifically, is that approximately 75 percent of scholars think that  at least one of the arguments for the empty tomb has force or something like that. My hypothesis is that he phrases it like this so that it's not that explicit claim. He's not reporting the number of scholars who are convinced of the empty tomb to fudge the numbers. Because he could count in those 75 percent even scholars who are, for example, agnostic about it as long as they think that at least one of the arguments for the empty tomb is an interesting argument to look at. 

> Kamil: I want to highlight this because here we see Lydia McGrew and Timothy McGrew reporting something other than what Gary Habermas reported. So here we have an example of how information is distorted, when is what is retold like. The meaning is different and it's *substantively* different. It's very important that the difference is not superficial. It's actually very, very important. There's a distortion of information that took place, even though we live in an environment where it's super easy and super convenient to get access to the text *exactly* as  Gary Habermas wrote it. Gary Habermas is still alive and I'm sure he would be able to answer any questions if they sent him an email. Now, imagine how much worse these kinds of distortions were in a society where people were not literate, they couldn't easily get a handle of the people who made the various claims that they are reporting.  They did not have instant access to texts as they were originally written.

> Brian: It's clear the McGraw's are right here because I don't hear Gary Habermas contradicting this and he'd be in a position to contradict this if it were actually incorrect.



[Time stamp 3:48:05](https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=13685)

> James:  there is a massive confusion between textual independence and independence of the witnesses that allegedly underpin that text. So it could be the case that I mean, obviously the Synoptics are not textual independent, but suppose that John and the Synoptics  are textually independent. And what I mean by that is that they sat down to write their text separately from each other that hadn't seen. Obviously, Mark hadn't seen John, but John hadn't seen the Synoptics  before (hypothetically). That would make them textually independent. But even if even if all four were textually independent, somehow that wouldn't make them independent of the underlying eyewitness testimony, which was based on a set of people who mostly experienced Jesus together, who talked to each other, as it says, even in the Gospels, and who allegedly came up with a creed that stated in propositional form some of the key beliefs that they had and passed it on to Paul and then that was disseminated in the other church. That is not what independent testimony looks like.

> Kamil: So you're saying something like the group appearances are actually evidence *against* the resurrection because like, it would be much more powerful if Jesus appears to people like individuals independent  of each other?
> 
> James: Yes, absolutely. That would be far more convincing, especially if they're in different cultures, that would be very much more convincing.

[Time stamp 3:52:35](https://youtu.be/yeCBpO7pSRM?t=13955)

> Nathan: On the other point, as well as to when they say the tensions in the narrative are evidence against copying, for example, because anyone who was copying could have gone. "I'm not going to introduce tension because that will make people further down the line think that, you know, like the stories don't cohere. But what if the later author, who had access to some earlier texts, actually disagreed theologically with something, is copying, but then decides, actually, I want to emphasize a different theological point. And so moves around the ordering of a story or maybe changes something. I mean, I think that stuff happens.And that introduces for us a tension story. And I don't think that that precludes copying. That would just be the motive that that would so they would have copied.  The case that there's a tension doesn't rule out copying. 

> James: I wonder how it rules out *embellishment*. They say it rules out embellishment the fact that they include different details. But that's exactly what embellishment is, right? That's particularly bizarre. 


## On the contradictions as evidence

> James: And so I don't see why you would expect this at all if I imagine that you were interviewing witnesses to a crime or some other event like and they tell you accounts that are somewhat similar. But the people that are involved are different and only partially overlap, and they're coming at different times. And there's all these other details as the McGrews acknowledge here, they give some examples that don't seem to obviously make sense and seem quite different. You would think that, well, look, maybe something happened here, but that these people are not terribly reliable,  they don't quite remember things properly or  they weren't really paying attention. Something's going on there, right? You wouldn't just think, Wow, this is really, obviously good testimony because, yeah, because they contradict. 

> James: And the short ending of Mark has basically nothing in common with the other accounts, except for the fact that the tomb is empty, like the women see it and then they're scared, and they and they run away and don't tell anyone.   That  has nothing in common with the others which say that they told the disciples and the disciples came, at least one of them did, and then that Jesus appeared to the disciples. How can you say that those are just circumstantial variety? There's massive differences in the account. 

> James: And it's not like people deliberately make these things up. It's like "it must have been". This is this is what Modern-Day  evangelicals do when they write their their harmonizations - "it must have been" then it turns into a new fact. So I think that that's probably like Well, "it must have been" that the women found it, but because no one would have taken them seriously, they didn't tell anyone --  because it accounts for why no one's heard of it before.


> Kamil: This is actually very consistent with our background knowledge about how, like ancient historiographers put together their accounts because it's often the case, some  historiographical  accounts are actually just very plausible reconstructions of what must have happened. 

> Kamil: for example, imagine that the author of The Gospel of Luke, a belief that Jesus was raised from the dead, [...] And based on those beliefs he created  a speculative version, what he perceived as as a plausible way the  resurrection appearances would play out. And this is why we actually have the text and it is not because there were actually people in history who experienced Jesus.  Plus, I think he was doing a lot of theological work as well. Like it specifically says that Jesus ate a piece of fish to rule out  believing that he's a ghost or phantasma, I think it says in Greek, which is a counter apologetic against people who believe that Jesus didn't have a physical body when he was around on Earth.  And I think the text being a product of this kind of historiographical practice is massively more inherently probable than Jesus *actually* being raised from the dead, *actually* appearing to people and *actually* eating fish. 

> Brian: Is it reasonable as a possibility that Mark, for instance, the women finding the tomb only because someone would make the argument that he wouldn't have put it in there unless it were true. And so this is a way of kind of making his stories sound more true, almost like I think the preface in Luke is kind of like that, where you  insert something that makes it sound like it's  legit. I think Lovecraft used to do that, throwing things in a fictional place (like a statement from a real journalist) to make it sound more legitimate.
> 
> Brian: Now, another another possibility, then, is if this argument has some weight that essentially having women testimony, it would be embarrassing and wouldn't be in it unless it were somehow legitimate, then you could think of almost textual or oral tradition evolution, where those stories that included that detail would be the ones that would get passed down.  It's an evolutionary argument for why we we end up with a text that has it, because that's the story that would have been told again and again, and it had this extra little element of, "Oh, and it's got to be true because..."

> Kamil:  That's a really interesting hypothesis, one possible hypothesis would be that this is a double bluff. Right? The author realized that, "Oh, if I put this detail, it's going to make it look more historically reliable precisely because it's counter intuitive". But this is another alternative that it's a process of natural selection, which selects for stories that look authentic, even though historically, they are not.

## On the Women's testimony

> James:  Well, look, the reason like this is why it says this is because people hadn't heard about this before. So they all thought the gospels need to explain why no one's heard about it before, at least why it's not more widely known, perhaps. So they're saying, Well, look, it was women and no one believed them or that the disciples didn't initially believe them. So maybe they didn't know about it, something like that?

> Kamil: Well, on my hypothesis, it actually becomes super, super easy to understand. By the time the gospel of Matthew is written, the author has not encountered the objection that the story is unreliable. By the time the gospel of Luke is written, this counter-apologetic is already the case. So there needs to be a counter-counter apologetic baked into the narrative to explain away or to invent additional data points to overcome the apologetic against the story.

Just now watching the part about the conversion of Paul, and thinking about some back-of-the-envelope calculations. They give this a Bayes factor of 10^3, and the likelihood given ~R is 10^-4. So that would mean the likelihood given R is 1/10. That seems crazy high imo, and it's not even clear that they should want a likelihood that high. If that's the case, and if, as I think is plausible, there's nothing special about Paul, they should give comparable likelihoods to every other non-persuaded jew getting an appearance from jesus. So the Bayes factor for every person who Jesus didn't appear to would be ~9/10 and so would count against the resurrection. But then it takes about sixty jews not getting an appearance from jesus to counterbalance the appearance to Paul. But A LOT more than sixty jews didn't get an appearance from Jesus. I wonder what they'd say if you tried to argue that each of the million or so jews who didn't get an appearance contributes an independent 9/10 to the bayes factor, so the final figure is somewhere around (9/10)^1000000 ~ 10^-50000.

Yeah, I've thought of this as well. They like to count the outsider Paul's conversion as evidence but what about all the Jews and Romans in Jerusalem who could have seen or heard about these things and didn't convert? Shouldn't that be factored in as showing the evidence must not have really been that compelling? Aside from Paul, the only people who Jesus appeared to were already close followers of his or knew him very well before his death. That looks a little suspicious because they would have already been biased towards believing this sort of thing if their leader Jesus really was making apocalyptic predictions.

Well that was interesting, for certain values of "interesting." I'd be hard pressed to create a more comprehensive straw man of the positions Lydia and I actually hold. Does anyone who has read our work, and in particular our recent work, think that this podcast actually engages with our positions, much less our arguments? Did the podcasters even bother, for example, to glance at the index of TMOM or EOB to look for "Synoptic Problem"?
