subtitle: Teaching Statistical Inference in the Bayesian Revolution

I'm giving a talk today, highlighting some of the current Bayesian/frequentist relationships as they relate to introductory statistics education.  You can [download the pdf here](pdf/Statistical%20Heresies.pdf).

> We live in a world where analytics in the form of statistical 
inference is playing a signiﬁcant role, from predicting 
elections, learning patterns in shopping habits, ﬁnding the 
genetic sources for diseases, and recognizing voice for 
computer control. Despite these successes, there is a serious 
disconnect between the best practices in the industry and 
what is typically taught at the undergraduate level. This 
faculty development seminar will introduce this problem, 
explore its history, present its causes, and make some modest 
proposals to solving it.

One comment after the fact - every single claim I made about why Bayes is not taught was demonstrated in the seminar.
