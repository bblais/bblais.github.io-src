Although I am not in software development, and I don't work in a lot of teams, I have recently read the book *Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time* (https://www.scruminc.com/new-scrum-the-book/) which I find very interesting and possibly quite useful[^1].  As far as I can tell, the Scrum process derives its value from a few key concepts, which can equally well apply to individuals as well as teams, to academia as well as software development.  These key concepts, as I see them is, 

1. Work is done in a short, cyclical pattern: 1-2 week "sprints"
2. The work - the goals, on deck (aka backlog), work in progress, and done - is *displayed publicly* (or at least prominently to the team) *at all times*.  This is typically done with a physical [scrum board](https://manifesto.co.uk/agile-concepts-scrum-task-board/), but can also be done in software.
3. A *demonstration* occurs at the end a work "sprint".  The result of the sprint is something *deliverable* and *complete*, even if small, and this is demonstrate to the people to whom the work has value.
4. A *review of the process and results* occurs regularly at the end of each sprint

If working on a team, we add the further concept

5. A team needs to have *absolutely everyone* who is needed to complete the work.  This will often involve people at many levels of a hierarchy.

As an addition, there are a few other things I learned from the book.

* The role of management is to *remove the impediments* to getting projects done.  So, part of the review process is to list the impediments to the work so that management can work on that.
* Short (15-minute) "scrum" meetings answering "what have I done since the last, what are my impediments, what am I going to get done"
* Focussing on *value* rather than work is more productive.
* The "deliver quickly" and adapt is a better strategy than trying to deliver a large, complete, and possibly incorrect product.


Meanwhile I am also working my way through the book *Agile Faculty: Practical Strategies for Managing Research, Service and Teaching.* (http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo26106581.html) I'm interested if any of these ideas will help in my own practices, and whether I can gain some benefit for the department and university processes with these ideas.
