I am a to-do list app junkie, unfortunately.  Actually, beyond that, I am a *productivity method* junkie. Of course, I recognize that in doing so I often make myself *less* productive.  Still it's a hard interest to shake.  Further, I find that when I switch to-do apps it makes it easier to throw out all kinds of items which I wasn't going to do anyway.  So I feel like I get a burst of productivity simply by switching to-do apps every 6 months to a year.  Here is a short list of the to-do apps I have tried, and some quick comments on them:

* [Todoist](https://en.todoist.com/) (current app) - good free app, but the premium is worth it.  I haven't used it for sharing to-do's but it has a clean interface and I can have it on my phone, mac, and windows tablet.  You need to pay for some features that Wunderlist has in the free - like reminders, comments, and attachments.
* [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) (former app) - nice free app, but seems to be aging a bit and there is no future support for it.  Microsoft hopes to replace it with their own To Do app. Doesn't archive projects at all (you have to delete them!)
* [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - a solid app, but mac/iphone only - and expensive!
* [Tick-tick](https://ticktick.com/) (as of June 2017) - maximum of 9 lists or go pro with $25/mo
* [Asana](https://asana.com/) - looks interesting, but perhaps overkill as a to-do app - more for teams

I've also tried, and rejected for various reasons:

* Firetask
* Todo Pro
* Astrid
* Taskpaper - nice idea for text-based to-dos, but a bit fragile
* OmniFocus - complete, huge learning curve, and quite pricey.  overkill for most of the things I need a to-do app to do.

This year, I am going to try out an analog solution [with bullet journal](http://bulletjournal.com/), once I figure out how it works.  I'll report on what I find!
