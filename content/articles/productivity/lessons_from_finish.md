Here are the lessons I learned from [Jon Acuff's book *Finish*](https://acuff.me/books/).

1. Cut Your Goal in Half
    - half done is better than none, psychologically
2. Choose what to bomb
    - what gives?  something will, and that's ok.  it's called "seasons".  
    - just say "no"
    - simplify
3. Make it fun if you want it done
    - give yourself rewards.  This is also in "The Power of Habit"
4. get rid of secret rules
    - avoid rules like "I'm not a ...."
5. use data to celebrate imperfect progress
    - track time, pages, words
    - track miles run, pounds
    - books sold, thank you notes mailed
    - new contacts, books read
6. the day before done
    - other ideas creep in - write them down for later, and don't let them derail you.
    - these ideas are your next project!
    - afraid of finishing?  don't be!
