I just posted an [8-minute movie I made] showing weather maps for 3 years from July 2011 to September 2014.  These surface maps are archived at the [Unisys Weather Image Archive], and are generated every 12 hours.  It's pretty cool to see the pattern of the weather sweeping across the US, and noting certain memorable storms.  Hurricane Sandy, for example, shows up at the end of October 2012 and you see the other front crossing the US at the same time, meeting Sandy on the East Coast.

Which things do you see?
