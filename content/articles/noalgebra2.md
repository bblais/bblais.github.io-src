title: Do we really need algebra 2 and calculus?

From time to time I hear proposals to restructure math or science secondary education.  Two examples are [an article in slate about algebra 2](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/education/2016/03/algebra_ii_has_to_go.html) and a [popular ted talk about calculus](http://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_benjamin_s_formula_for_changing_math_education).  In each case, the argument goes that *statistics* - and I would add *probability* - is far more useful to a larger fraction of students than, say, calculus or algebra 2.  I think the argument has merit, although I think that algebra 2 is probably needed to do much of statistics and I should stress that those students going into the sciences or engineering really still need both calculus and statistics.

For an interesting discussion, see [this Quora thread](https://www.quora.com/Should-statistics-replace-calculus-as-the-most-advanced-math-course-in-the-high-school-curriculum).  None of the counter arguments are convinving to me but there is some nuance to the argument expressed that I feel is productive.
