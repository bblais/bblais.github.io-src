I'd like to walk through some of the "*Statistics 101*" examples (e.g. estimating $\mu$ with known $\sigma$, estimating a proportion, etc...) for which we have simple analytical solutions, but explore them with [MCMC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTUwEu53uzs).  The reason I want to do this is to introduce MCMC on simple cases, which are not much different than more complicated cases, but are better understood.  The second reason is to explore some cases which are nearly as easy, but are never covered in introductory textbooks.  In all of these I'm going to use a python library I make for my science-programming class, [stored on github](https://github.com/bblais/sci378), and the [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.  Install like:

```
pip install "git+git://github.com/bblais/sci378" --upgrade
pip install emcee
```


We'll start with the easiest example:  there is some true value, we call $\mu$.  The $N$ data points we have, $\{x_i\}$, consist of that true value with added independent, normally-distributed noise of *known* scale, $\sigma$.  


For a Bayesian solution, we need to specify the likelihood function -- how our model produces the data -- and the prior probability for the parameters.  The likelihood function is determined like

$$
\begin{eqnarray}
x_i &\sim& \mu + \epsilon_i \\
P(x_i|\mu,\sigma) &\sim& \text{Normal}(x_i-\mu,\sigma) \\
P(\{x_i\}|\mu,\sigma) &\sim& \prod_i \text{Normal}(x_i-\mu,\sigma) 
\end{eqnarray}
$$
known $\sigma$

In the "*Statistics 101*" examples, the results are typically equivalent to *uniform* priors on the parameters, so we'll assume uniform priors on $\mu$.  


```python
def lnlike(data,μ):
    # known σ
    x=data
    return lognormalpdf(x,μ,σ)

data=array([12.0,14,16])
σ=1
model=MCMCModel(data,lnlike,
                μ=Uniform(-50,50),
                )
```

now we run MCMC, plot the chains (so we can see it has converged) and look at distributions,

```python
model.run_mcmc(800,repeat=3)
model.plot_chains()
```

```

```python

```

compare to textbook solution (i.e. Normal with deviation $\sigma/\sqrt{N}$),

```python
x,y=model.get_distribution('μ')
plot(x,y,'-')
μ̂=mean(data)
N=len(data)
σμ=σ/sqrt(N)
y_pred=[exp(lognormalpdf(_,μ̂,σμ)) for _ in x]
plot(x,y_pred,'r--')
```

and finally find a tail-area probability, the Bayesian equivalent to Z-test,

```python
model.P('μ>15')
```

```
0.037066666666666664
```

This simple example can be a template for more complex problems, which I will explore in later posts of this series.  What do you think?
