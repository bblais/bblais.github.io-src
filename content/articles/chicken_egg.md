why is no one mentioning the chicken?  the event which is paralleled with the resurrection in the article is a the single claim by a vet that a chicken gave birth to a chick internally, without laying the egg.  as a skeptic, I thought "well, that's unusual" but am inclined to believe it - although not particularly strongly.  why? 

1) we have the word of a trained scientist, who'd be in the position to tell the difference between a hoax and something legit.
2) we understand that the biological mechanisms of birth are stochastic, and this sort of thing is totally within the possibility of the biology.
3) it led to the death of the hen, which is the most likely outcome in such a fluke case
4) although the prior probability of such a thing happening is small, we have a *lot* of chickens.  It's like winning the lottery twice - it happens frequently because there are so many people playing lotteries.

finally, 

5) I'm still a little dubious, because I can't find any other corroboration, and it is sensational enough to warrant making it up, so I wouldn't stake my life on the story.  

Maybe a probability of about 80 percent?

Now, ask yourself, other than point (5), does the resurrection have an analogous match to any of the points 1-4?
