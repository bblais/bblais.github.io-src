 *[Twitter, Zombies, and the Fate of the World](http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/pdf/Twitter Zombies and the Fate of the World.pdf)* is my presentation today at the [Analytics without Borders Conference](http://www.bentley.edu/analytics-without-borders). 

Dynamical systems are mathematical constructions containing multiple interacting parts which vary in time. This can include physical systems such as those in astronomy or systems of interacting behaviors like those found in economics. Here we present some recent work combining the dynamical systems approach to several problems, including the spread of ideas on Twitter and the spread of zombie infections, with the statistical methods of Bayesian parameter estimation. We will also present a how-to guide to using these examples in a classroom setting, appropriate for undergraduate students and for the communication of those ideas to the public.
