In their article, [*Top 10 problems with biological and chemical evolution*](http://www.discovery.org/a/24041), the Discovery Institute outlines their best critiques of evolution (i.e. biological evolution) and abiogenesis (i.e. chemical evolution). As my next response I'm going to respond to [Problem 4: Natural Selection Struggles to Fix Advantageous Traits into Populations](http://www.discovery.org/a/24041#problem4).  

We start with a quote from the article:

>Evolutionary biologists often assume that once mutations produce a functionally advantageous trait, it will easily spread (become "fixed") throughout a population by natural selection. For example, imagine a population of brown-haired foxes which lives in a snowy region. One fox is born with a mutation which turns its fur coat white, rather than brown. This fox now has an advantage in hunting prey and escaping predators, because its white fur provides it with camouflage in the snow-filled environment. The white fox survives, passing its genes on to its offspring, which are also adept at surviving and reproducing. Over time, the white-haired trait spreads throughout the population.

>This is how it's supposed to work -- in theory. In the real world, however, merely generating a functionally advantageous trait does not guarantee it will persist, or become fixed. For example, what if by chance the white fox trips, breaks a leg, and gets eaten by a predator -- never passing on its genes? Random forces or events can prevent a trait from spreading through a population, even if it provides an advantage. 

I would agree with that.  Being an unguided process, evolution has a fair amount of randomness in it - no big surprise.  One consequence of this is that the process needs a great deal of time for an advantageous trait to possibly become dominant.  Sometimes this occurs in a relatively isolated environment (e.g. islands) and thus can become domninant more rapidly, but in general it will take a long time.
