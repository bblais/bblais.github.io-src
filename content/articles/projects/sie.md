This is a new approach to an introductory statistical inference textbook, motivated by probability theory as logic.  It is targeted to the typical *Statistics 101* college student, and covers the topics typically covered in the first semester of such a course.  It is freely available under the Creative Commons License, and includes a software library in Python for making some of the calculations and visualizations easier.  

### Get the book
* Download the [latest version of the book]
* The print book is [available on Amazon], or directly [on Createspace]
* Download the [latest version of the software].  It requires the installation of a scientific distribution of Python, such as the [Anaconda distribution].
