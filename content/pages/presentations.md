* Blais, B.S. *[What Do Zombies, Vampires, and Three-Sided Coins Have in Common? A Research Scientist's Journey into the Weird and Wonderful](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16rNGQcohzxjyZ1Jys4JsjeAeloXthn1n&usp=drive_fs)*. 
> This talk explores the variety of projects Professor Blais has had involving undergraduate research students. The projects span a wide range of topics from the zombie apocalypse, three-sided coins, and brain modeling but have common features in probability, statistics, and simulation. Also covered will be the process for picking a topic in the first place, what the steps are for doing research, and the timeline for an honors thesis. 


# 2022

* Blais, B.S., Gaier, E.,Xiao, S. *[Modeling amblyopia treatment responses through principles of synaptic plasticity](https://github.com/bblais/Amblyopia)*. May 2022. ARVO Conference.
> The BCM principles of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity are sufficient to model the ocular dominance shifts underlying the development of and recovery from amblyopia. The importance of the dichoptic masks and contrast disparity levels on the efficacy of the binocular therapy model suggests that these parameters require precise refinement to optimize amblyopia recovery.
