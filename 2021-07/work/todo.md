  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:The former is easy to show is \$latex {p(2g|\\{L1g\\})=1/3}&fg=000000\$.
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:The latter is shown to be \$latex {p(2g|\\{L1g\\},F)=1/2}&fg=000000\$.
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    \$latex \\displaystyle p(2H) = \\frac{4}{8} \\times {3}{7} =
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    \$latex \\displaystyle p(2H|\\{L1H\\}) =
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    where \$latex {p(H\_1,S\_2)}&fg=000000\$ is that we drew a heart
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    \$latex \\displaystyle \\begin{array}{rcl} p(2H|\\{L1H\\}) &=&
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    \$latex \\displaystyle p(2H|\\{L1H\\},A) =
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    \$latex \\displaystyle p(H\_{1a},H\_{2n}) =
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    ace of hearts, and then turning over card 2. \$latex
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    is really the same as seeing any ol' heart, so it is \$latex
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    \$latex \\displaystyle p(H\_{1n},H\_{2a}) =
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    the first card is still \$latex {p(H\_{1n})=3/8}&fg=000000\$.
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    knowledge that at least one is an ace. Thus, \$latex
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    \$latex \\displaystyle
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    Notice that if \$latex {H\_{2a}}&fg=000000\$ had been independent of
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    \$latex {H\_{1n}}&fg=000000\$ then we would have gotten the same
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    with \$latex {p(H\_{2a}|S\_1)}&fg=000000\$, but since we compare to
  wordpress_migration/the-florida-problem-a-new-intuition.md:    \$latex \\displaystyle \\begin{array}{rcl} p(2H|\\{L1H\\},A) &=&
  wordpress_migration/things-science-cant-explain.md:    > \$latex {F \\sim 1/r\^2}\$, and not some other form, like inverse
