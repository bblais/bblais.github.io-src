> Physics aspires to describe the world in entirely objective terms, in terms that could be understood by anyone, whatever his or her life experience. Visiting aliens might have incredibly different sensory organs, and as a result they might not be able to understand or appreciate our art or our music. But if they are intelligent enough to understand mathematics, then they will be able to grasp our physics.

> the conscious life of a particular organism can only be understood by adopting the perspective of that organism There will always be something we cannot grasp about bats, namely, what it is like to be a bat. To say that reality can be exhaustively described in such terms is to say that there are no subjective properties , i.e., no features of reality that can be grasped only from a certain perspective

Wrong. We can describe reflex objectively. We can control consciousness to some degree with drugs and electrically. We don't understand to that level the self model. But if we did, we could explain the conditions for subjective experience. Could we experience it ourselves? Not yet but a full understanding/manipulation would allow us to.

"Subjective" is the result of the activation of the self model.

> Mary comes to know all the physical facts involved in color experience.

Mary would know the neural processes necessary for color experience in order to elicit those processes artificially so that her brain is able to construct the color model of the world.

> Mary at this point learns something new: she learns what it's like to have a yellow experience.

This might not happen. Could be her neural model has discarded or summed independent color info like it does with motion info raised in a strobe light.

> what pre-liberation Mary has learned is the complete and final theory of color experience. It follows that she ought to know all of the essential features of color experience, just as someone who knows the complete and final theory of black holes ought to know all the essential features of black holes .

I dont think so. What about understanding a flame?

Not necessarily --- think superconductivity.

> All we are imagining is that she has more of the same kind of information available to contemporary neuroscientists.

That's a pretty silly limitation given that we know that we don't know much. We don't even know what will be the type of info needed

> we have made considerable progress and a complete account of these mechanisms will presumably be some nonrevolutionary extension of what we have already .

Really? How do you get that? Think superconductivity. Cooper pairs come out and in some way revolutoinary

> The Key Premise---Someone who has been blind from birth could not, through reading neuroscience (in braille), discover what it's like to have a yellow experience.

Again needlessly restrictive. Someone who reads all about newtons laws cant understand gravity waves.

> Colours, like tones and tastes, are firsthand sensory experiences, and no amount of acquired theoretical knowledge can create this experience.

Sure but this is the wrong question.

> It is clear that Nordby takes there to be some essential features of color experiences that he's missing out on.

Yes. The model his brain has constructed is insufficient to explain all of the world. Just like bees see UV so flowers look really different to them. We don't need that for survival so it isn't part of our experience.

> The neuroscience we have already gives color-blind scientists like Nordby absolutely no grasp of the qualities of color experience, and it seems extremely unlikely that the completion of this ongoing project would make a substantial difference in this regard.

This is like tying arms behind your back and demanding to climb a rope ladder. Silly.
