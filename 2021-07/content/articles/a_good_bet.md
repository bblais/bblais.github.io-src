So I was sitting in the cafeteria the other day, and there was a clock which showed the wrong time and the second hand was being weird.  I noted that the second hand was broken, and not advancing properly, and a student of mine said "No, the second hand is just advancing two seconds at a time, but it counting out the correct time."  I looked briefly again, and it didn't seem that way, so I bet $1 (my highest bet).

Enthusiastically, we sat there for a minute or so, independently timing the clock and it turned out she was right and I was wrong.  I happily handed over the $1, and was glad to know one fewer wrong thing in the universe.  That is the attitude that we need to instill in our students, and in the public.  Here are a few attitudes that we need to encourage:

* it is good to be shown to be wrong, and one should be happy when it happens
* it is good to update ones belief based on the evidence
* it is good to actively look for ways to challenge your beliefs
* it is good to put your money where your mouth is

If more of our politicians had this scientific attitude, the world would be a better place.
