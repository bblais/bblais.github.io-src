So I've decided to start a project which will be posted here as I go
along. Essentially, it is based off of the [Unbelievable podcast][],
which for those who don't know is a British podcast/radio show featuring
debates between Christians and non-Christians. My plan is to respond to
every episode from the archive, with some small constraints. I expect
this will take at least a year, possibly a bit more, but structure many
of my ideas as I go through it.

The rules are quite simple for which episodes I will address, and which
parts of the episodes I'll addresss:

1.  I will listen to just the debate, not the emails or the call-ins
2.  I will only listen to atheist vs Christian debates, not Christian vs
    Christian debates
3.  I will only listen to Christian topics, not Islam, Hindu, Paganism,
    or other religious topics

These rules are set for my own personal interest, and also to play to my
strengths. I am not as informed of the intricacies of Hinduism, for
example. I am also not interested in hearing a discussion between
Christians about the particular implications of the Trinity.
