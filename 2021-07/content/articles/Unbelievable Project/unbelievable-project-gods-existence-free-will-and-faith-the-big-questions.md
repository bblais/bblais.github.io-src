### Notes

Tim - personal experience can be evidence for God's existence, like the
perception of a table is evidence of a table. it's a phenomenon,
although it can be tricky to map it to reality.

**Me - the idea is one of verifiability, which distinguishes these sorts
of things. Tim points out that many have had personal experiences to
verify other religions. This, in a single stroke, eliminates it as a
reasonable form of evidence.**

Jonathan - three biggies historically. cosmological - God must exist
because the Universe must have a cause. , God is by definition uncaused,
a necessary being. the universe could have not existed (nothing), or a
different one, so it is contingent. this must come from a necessary
being. - I'm not very convinced of arguments of this kind - it doesn't
really prove God, but some *"first thing"*

**Me - I agree! however, I am not convinced with this contingent,
necessary distinction. can we demonstrate it? Can we find an example? Is
it a meaningful distinction?**

Jonathan - teleological - argument from design. quotes from Marcus
Minucius Felix late 2nd century  
*"hold up your eyes to starry heavens, behold the planets wheeling in
their pre-ordained course. look at the turning of the seasons, the rain
and the snow, the sun, the planets, everything works together."* how
could you look at that say that there is no God.

**Me - each of these is described *better* by physics and biology. this
argument from incredulity is not a solid argument. and we easily
recognize this now.  
**

Jonathan - ontological. there is a God based on a definition of God. God
is defined as perfection. one of the perfections is necessary existence.

**Me (and Justin) - just saying it doesn't make it so. this point was
responded to, by asserting that *"we are simply exploring the concept"*.
However, the objection still holds even in this case.**
