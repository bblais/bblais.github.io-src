Title: What's the Harm in Alternative Medicine?

Subtitle: An Explicit Death Toll

When challenging the bogus medical claims of herbalists, chiropractors, and homeopaths one is often countered with the question "what's the harm?"  How could harm come from a treatment that, even if false, doesn't do anything?  Well, we have an example in the recent news of the ebola outbreak.  

We hear that the outbreak in Sierra Leone, with the death toll in the hundreds now, was started by an herbalist claiming cures of ebola that were unfounded.  No more can one honestly claim that no harm is done by alternative medicine.  It's just too bad it takes such a tragedy for some to come to this realization.  For others, this may not even be enough.
