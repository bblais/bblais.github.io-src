I just watched a very nice video about our short time on this planet. I
particularly like how he says we "defy entropy and impermanence through
our films and our poems". I would only add that we also transcend it
through the human enterprise we call science. It reminds me of the
mantra "leave the world a better place", and I hope I do that in my
small way.
