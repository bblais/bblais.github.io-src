Articles like [this one][] and [this one][1] and others make the
comparison between, what they call, global warming deniers and evolution
deniers (aka Intelligent Design (ID) proponents), and even holocaust
deniers. Personally, I find these comparisons misleading and dangerous.
It is true that there are some who believe that climate is not changing
at all, and that flies in the face of all of our knowledge of climate,
weather, and the Earth system. Then there are those, like in
[climateaudit.org][], that criticize the statistics of the data, and the
possible false conclusions that can arise from that, and the lack of
transparency on such an important topic. Lumping them in with the ID
crowd is just ridiculous.

Why is the scientific consensus on Anthropomorphic Global Warming (AGW)
different than the scientific consensus on Evolution? Let me list some
of the ways:

1.  Evolution has many independent, very different, lines of evidence
    (fossils, embryology, immunology, molecular biology, paleontology,
    etc...). AGW has at best 50-100 different data sets, from the dozen
    or so tree rings, to the dozen or so ice cores, satellite and
    surface temperature records. Much of our inference comes from
    computer simulations, that a very few completely understand. Much of
    global warming consensus comes from a small minority that are
    directly involved with the data or the simulations.
2.  We can control aspects of evolution. With knowledge of DNA, we can
    make genetically modified foods, we can change the course of
    diseases, and breed bacteria to eat nylon. Our understanding of AGW
    is at such a low level that we can only possibly control the climate
    at the grossest level. Our lack of understanding of feedback loops
    prevents even the most basic possible control of the system.
3.  Although evolution occurs on long time scales, we can see its action
    on the small scale. AGW also occurs on longish time scales, but
    there is no short-term equivalent. This adds to our level of control
    (with evolution), or lack of it with AGW.
4.  Those that are denying evolution want to replace it with something
    that violates not just evolution, but all of physics, chemistry,
    astronomy...pretty much all of science. Although the extremists in
    the anti-global warming camp can seem pretty anti-science, they
    aren't trying to replace global warming with something that violates
    all of science (they still might be wrong!). There is also a much
    more nuanced camp that admits that the planet is warmer, but perhaps
    it is not as special as the AGW theory would suggest, and that
    draconian CO2 policies are unwarranted given the uncertainties. This
    puts it on a very different scale than the anti-evolution group.

It is dangerous to make the comparison. One is partly the demonizing of
your opponent and, at the same time, angelizing (is that a word? :) )
ones own perspective: by saying that the AGW deniers are just like the
evolution deniers, both makes the deniers seem unreasonable, but by
association, implies that AGW is as solid as evolution. This latter
claim, despite the claims of its proponents, is definitely hyperbole.
