I just listened to a recent [Unbelievable podcast][], an episode about
the [origin of life][].  The creationist made the claim that all of the
scientific attempts at a naturalistic, non-design method for creating
the initial life on the planet have met with dead ends.  He further
added that this should make one start considering supernatural, design
methods for creating the initial life.

Aside from not understanding science, a question stuck in my head, and I
think the answer really shows the hand of these so-called intelligence
design "scientists" as religionists in disguise.  The question is the
following:

> Once you rule out all of the naturalistic, non-design explanations
> [which we haven't, by the way], and if design is so evident in the
> biological molecules, then the next step should be to consider and
> rule out naturalistic ***design*** explanations…i.e. alien life
> designed life on this planet.  

Why is this explanation never raised by ID proponents?  They claim that
the "designer" is not, necessarily, God yet I never see them rule out
alien minds as the designers.  They jump from naturalistic, non-design
right over to supernatural "explanations".  I think, when pressed, they
would have to deal with alien design, and their true nature.
