One of the so-called fine-tuned parameters in our solar system
(fine-tuned specifically for the development of complex life) is that we
have a planet with a large moon (compared to the planet).  In his long
list of supposed fine tunings, Hugh Ross mentions that [we even need a
big moon to have life on this planet.][] Much of the fine tuning
argument is a thinly veiled God-of-the-Gaps argument: we can't explain
it, therefore God must have done it.  One of the things that happens to
such arguments is that people finally explain it.  So, in that vein, we
have the following idea that [we may not need such a large moon after
all][we even need a big moon to have life on this planet.].

This is one example of lack of imagination leading to erroneous
arguments.  The problem is not the mistake itself, it's that once you
attribute a theological "solution" to your problem, then you cease to
look for the truth.
