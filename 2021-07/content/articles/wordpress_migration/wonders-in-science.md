This is one of the [Hubble deep field images][]:

It is important to note that every little bright smudge on this image is
a **galaxy** with *billions of stars*. This image is a very small piece
of the sky, around 1 out of 150 million, making estimates of galaxies in
the visible universe around 100 billion. It is worth pausing and
thinking about that. When I think about the majesty of the universe I
find it infinitely more inspiring than the parochial, one-world God, of
the major religions. Just trying to *imagine* our place in this
vastness, and to imagine that there are other beings out there doing the
same thing, wondering if they are alone, there is a sense of awe and
wonder that is difficult to describe. Try it sometime: try to grasp,
even for a few seconds, what billions of billions of worlds would be
like, spread across a space that takes millions of years for light to
cross when light can circle the earth in (literally) the snap of a
finger.
