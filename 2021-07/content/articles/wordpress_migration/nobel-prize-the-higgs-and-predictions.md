So around 50 years ago a number of scientists made a prediction for an
unseen particle (typically referred to as the 'Higgs boson' but also
sometimes as the 'God particle' - a silly name if I ever heard one)
which, if it existed, [helped to fill in an explanation of the
fundamental laws of the universe][].  It took 50 years, thousands of
people, and millions of dollars to directly confirm this prediction
but[it was done last year][]...and thus is [deserving of a Nobel
Prize][].

The Nobel Prize can only be give to at most three scientists, so the
letter-of-the-law committee [omitted three other scientists][] who also
contributed to this prediction.  I had the fortune to take high energy
physics with one of these, Prof Gerry Guralnik, at Brown University.

To think that we, as a species, are able to predict something so subtle
in the universe, decades before our ability to actually confirm it, is
truly astounding.  In times like this I have a feeling of optimism for
our species, an awe for the amazing structure in the universe that we
have uncovered, and an excitement for the things that we have yet to
discover.
