I have a backlog of blog posts that I wanted to get caught up on. This
blog has been pretty academic lately, so I figured a change of pace
would be nice. I figured I'd post some of my thoughts on the Lord of the
Rings. To set the record straight, I really like the books and the
movies, but I noticed something about the movies which disturbs me
somewhat: in nearly every case where the movie deviates from the books,
it is in the direction of *weakening* the characters. The more I thought
about it, the more I realized that the pattern is held. Here I give a
summary list of the changes to the characters. Perhaps there are more
examples. Are there any counter examples?

1.  nearly gets killed by an orc, and needs to be revived [M]
2.  is not strong enough when looking in the Palantir, to counter Sauron
    (drops it) [M]

<tr>
<td>
Sauron!

</td>
<p>
<td>
1.  information about the attack on Minas Tirith is leaked to Pippin's
    mind during the contact with the Palantir [M]
2.  Everyone knew where the next attack would be, and the attack is
    rushed due to Aragorn's confrontation in the Palantir [B]

Eowyn

Faramir

Eomer + Minas Tirith

</td>
<p>
<td>
1.  Rohan and Minas Tirith are not enough to combat the first army of
    Sauron, and need the dead (called by Aragorn) to clear them out. [M]
2.  Only the back-up armies and navies of Sauron are cleared out by the
    dead called by Aragorn, and the Rohan is enough to fend off the
    armies at Minas Tirith itself. [B]

King Theoden

</td>

1.  Theoden needs Aragorn's prompting to help Minas Tirith. [M]
