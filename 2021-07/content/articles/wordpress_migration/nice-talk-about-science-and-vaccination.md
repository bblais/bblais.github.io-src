The site <http://www.ted.com/> is a really great site to find talks on
lots of different topics. The one I recently listened to is
<http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_specter_the_danger_of_science_denial.html>,
which highlights some of the dangers of the recent anti-vax movement.
Lots of other great links at
