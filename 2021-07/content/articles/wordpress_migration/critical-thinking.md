A [recent post on critical thinking][] from one of my favorite climate
blogs.   In a nutshell there is:

-   Constantly check one’s views against evidence from the real world.
-   Think in terms of multiple, rather than single, causes.
-   Think in terms of the sizes of things, rather than only in terms of
    their direction.
-   Know many small things and pragmatically apply a “grab bag” of
    knowledge to make modest predictions about the world (as opposed to
    knowing one big thing and applying that to everything around)
-   Understand one’s own biases.

From a [total different talk on a totally different topic,][] critical
thinking is partly a skill-set and partly an attitude.  

What is interesting here is that this list conforms to most of the
[lessons that one draws from Bayes theorem][].
