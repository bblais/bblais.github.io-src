So I received a [tweet asking for support for the Darwin Day
Resolution][].

The full text of the resolution is here:

> Expressing support for designation of February 12, 2011, as Darwin Day

> humanity.  
> Whereas Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by the mechanism of

> Whereas the validity of Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural

I was reading it with some interest, but then I get to the part about
“the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change”. Why is
climate change in there? There are so many obvious, uncontroversial
topics directly related to evolution in medicine, pharmaceuticals,
ecology, physiology, etc... that it seems to be both irrelevant and
counterproductive to include it. Sure, the climate change folks think
that denying it is like denying the holocaust or denying evolution, but
it really isn’t nearly at that level. There are not the number of
independent investigations and data supporting man-influenced climate
change as there are for either evolution or the holocaust, even if the
science were completely unambiguous on the topic (which it isn’t). To
conflate the two is a serious tactical mistake, and a serious scientific
mistake.

Although I support Darwin Day, I can’t support this resolution because
of this ridiculous add-on.
