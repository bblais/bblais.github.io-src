Title: Religion and Scientists

A friend of mine posted [this Slashdot brief][] on Facebook, which also
[links to this summary][]. The articles both imply a much stronger
religiosity among scientists than is traditionally assumed, quoting the
work of Elaine Ecklund. Some key quotes from these two short summaries
are:

-   "Fully half of these top scientists are religious. Only five of the
    275 interviewees actively oppose religion"
-   Even among the third who are atheists, many consider themselves
    "spiritual."
-   The study reveals that scientists often practice a closeted faith,
    worrying about how their peers would react to learning about their
    religious views.
-   The '"insurmountable hostility" between science and religion is a
    caricature, a thought-cliche, perhaps useful as a satire on
    groupthink, but hardly representative of reality,' writes Ecklund.

So, when I read this, I thought "Wow! Half of these scientists are
religious? Spiritual atheists? Closeted faith? That's amazing stuff!".
So, as a scientist myself, I decided to [look at the study itself][]. I
confirmed what [another blogger stated][]: essentially the conclusions
come from some "new math", and vague statements.

The study included these results:

-   34% chose “I don't believe in God,”
-   30% chose “I do not know if there is a God, and there is no way to
    find out.”

which equals 64%. So "fully half" must mean "less than 36%". That's some
good arithmetic! Oh, and

-   8% chose “I believe in a higher power, but it is not God.”

So I guess religious doesn't imply belief in God, so it goes in the very
vague category. If religious includes a belief in God (and I guess in
her book she uses "traditionally religious"), then "fully half" must
mean "less than 28%".

So about 25% of all scientists profess a belief in God, compared to a
public of about 80%. That's a pretty stark contrast! I'd wager that
there must be something (or somethings) that makes this negative
correlation between science and religion. I think it is difficult to
argue that there is not some inherent conflict between the two given
this contrast. What about the closeted religious scientists? Those
shouldn't appear in these anonymous polls, and thus do not affect any of
these numbers. If a scientist doesn't want to bring up their religion
with their peers, then 1) what does that say about the strength of their
beliefs and 2) perhaps the religious aspects of their life are
irrelevant to their scientific work. The closeted religious were not
mentioned at all in the study, by the way.

Spirituality
------------

[In another monograph][], Ecklund discusses her work. In it she states:

In this way, it is possible for atheists to be "spiritual". To me, I
think this is really bad terminology and easily misused. For most
people, "spiritual" implies some some "spirit", or an existence separate
from the body. These scientists are making no claim like that, they
simply mean a feeling still bound to the biology of our bodies.
Unfortunately, by using the term "spiritual" it can be used (as here) to
enhance the notion that these scientists are religious, or leaning
toward religion, which is misleading at best. A religious friend of mine
once recently said that she thought I was spiritual. I thought the term
was basically meaningless and ill-defined, and still do.

Religious Scientists
--------------------

Is it surprising that there are religious scientists? Not at all.
Because most of the public is religious, most scientists are raised with
some religion. It is also human nature to separate different,
conflicting, modes of thinking in different contexts. It is very easy
for someone to study superconductivity and not have it interfere or
conflict with any of their views of the divine. I've [written about
religion in other posts][], and will only add that I believe that much
of religion comes from the skills we have to help our survival: it is
better to see a tiger when there isn't one than to not see a tiger when
there is one. From there, combine with cultural structures, it is easy
to see how religious ideas propagate. The great thing about science is
that its methods allow us to transcend these false-positives, and arrive
at ways to discern truth from fiction. Because we're human, it doesn't
work 100% of the time, but in the long run it has been our most
successful human creation.

It is no surprise to me that *some* scientists are religious. It would
have been a surprise to me to hear that "fully half" are religious, and
as it turns out that isn't true.
