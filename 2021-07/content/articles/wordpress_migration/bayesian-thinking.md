I'm a big fan of Bayesian reasoning, and I like the idea of applying it
to human intelligence.  Usually it is in terms of failures of reasoning,
compared with the gold-standard of Bayes.  That's why I like [this post
from Andrew Gelman's blog][] about [this post from Slate][] where they
present evidence that even very young children think in a Bayesian way.
 The discussion centers around contrasting children and adults in terms
of the priors they have when approaching a new problem.  Gelman makes
the point that the failures in adults can also occur because out
internal models tend to be discrete and the real-world is continious.
 It is very interesting to see how these sorts of mappings from theory
to reality are made.  In general, how do we infer what internal
representations of models we are actually employing?
