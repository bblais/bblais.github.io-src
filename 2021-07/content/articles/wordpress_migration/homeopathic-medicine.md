Homeopathic medicine "is a form of alternative medicine, first expounded
by German physician Samuel Hahnemann in 1796, that treats patients with
heavily diluted preparations which are thought to cause effects similar
to the symptoms presented." (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy>).
I saw the mock video below on the skeptics blog,
<http://skepticblog.org/>, and thought it was so amusing I had to post
it here. I've known people who swear by this stuff, which is
unfortunate. Treatments like these, that don't work, are dangerous and
can actually kill people by diverting them from legitimate treatment. A
good analysis of this is at <http://www.csicop.org/si/9709/park.html>.

The video, however, is quite amusing.
