It is a common argument now from the so-called new atheists that we
don’t get our morality from scripture. I am not sure that many religious
people, even biblical literalists, would defend such a claim...so in a
way it really is a strawman. Francis Collins, following CS Lewis, place
morality front and center in their justification for their belief in
God, but at no time do they say that it comes *from scripture*. They
claim that morality is, in essence, programmed into us as a gift from
the divine creator. The universality of altruism is used in an argument
from Collins for a behavior that cannot be selected for, and is thus an
indication of a supernatural, moral creator. He never once says that the
morality comes from scripture. Seen in this way, then scripture forms a
guide which may need to be interpreted for the changing times, even if
you are a literalist. I think it would be wiser for the new atheists to
ask if scripture can even be a good *guide* for behavior, without
hammering the (strawman) point that scripture is not the *source* of
morality.

Perhaps they should poll their audience on the question of where they
believe morality comes from. If a significant fraction states that it
comes from scripture, then it no longer is a strawman. I just don’t
think it would come out that way.
