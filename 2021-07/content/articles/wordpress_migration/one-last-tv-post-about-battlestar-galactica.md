No TV posts for a while after this one...just trying to clear my desk.

There are a number of things that bother me about BSG. This list is here
for anyone who  
wants to challenge me on any of this, comment please! It's in the form
of loose-fitting  
notes, written over the course of watching the series. There are
spoilers, etc...

​1)   
Once they find out that Cylons look like us, and they consider a Cylon  
detector, they seem to hand the entire problem over to Dr. Baltar.   
There seems to be no consideration about whether he is a Cylon, or  
in league with the Cylons. What could they do differently? Have the   
Dr make something that is independently testable, perhaps by Gaita or  
others. They don't even consider it.

​2)   
I find it straining in the extreme to believe that there is no   
straightforward test to tell a Cylon from non-Cylon, given the actions  
and words of the various people. Cylons:  
1) are stronger than people  
2) do not tire  
3) are able to be uploaded, at least at death  
4) have backs that glow under certain conditions  
5) have fiber optic interfaces in their arms!

points 1 and 2 would almost certainly leave indicators in the muscle  
cells, as well as brain waves. point 3 on brain waves, and point  
4 certainly should be detectable. point 5 should be obvious!

At other points, they say that they are basically indistiguishable,  
which to my mind means that they have organic processes (even if  
artificially made), and even their brain activity is the same, to the   
point of being indistinguishable from a person. If that is the case,  
then it seems weird to talk about them having "software, not emotions".
  
It's a looks like a duck, acts like a duck, every possible measurement  
confirms it's a duck, but it's not a duck? Sorry, that's just too hard  
to swallow.

So you have the problem that, either, they are very different in which  
case they should be detectable, or they are identical, in which case  
they are no different than humans. The writers seem to want it   
both ways.

What would my solution be? If these models were designed for the
express  
purpose of infiltratration into the fleet, then there would have been   
a lot of work to make them undetectable. I would say that the innards  
would be clearly mechanical/organic, with an organic outside. The
inside  
would broadcast signals to fool scans, like MRI and CAT scans, while  
the outside would have blood, sweat, etc... to fool observation there.  
It wouldn't be too hard to imagine that the only way to test for such  
a thing would entail tests that would be lethal to a person, which   
might solve some of the writers' problems.

Whenever someone said "they aren't human, they are machines" I cringed,
and wanted  
to reply: what do you mean by machines? In which ways are they machines
and humans  
aren't? throughout the series, the cylons were humans when convenient,
and   
machines when convenient. I don't think the writers had a consistent
vision of   
what the cylons were, or wanted.

​3) WTF is the cylon plan. They want all humanity destroyed, but then  
they seem to want humans for procreation and love. They say they want  
to protect Sharon's baby, and then the next episode (!) they launch  
an all-out attack on the fleet. They have well hidden spies in the  
Galactica who could have done damage to the ship, that was going to   
be a museum anyway, and they were unable to destroy it? How hard would  
it have been to put one of those Cylon viruses in the computer,
dormant,  
and then when the fleet was assembled have it relay random jump points  
to all of the fleet, and then send the Galactica into a star?

The writers seem to use Cylon attacks, and then Cylon pleasantness or  
incompleteness, for convenience. It's back to the "not like us, just  
like us" problem above which leads to inconsistent behavior. I think  
there was no plan, so these inconsistencies keep compounding over time.

​4) In flight of the Phoenix, when they disabled a huge number of cylon
  
raiders, why didn't they capture some of them for use later? Seems  
like a major tactical failure.

​5) In the 1st season episode when they were looking for Starbuck, who
had  
crashed on a planet with a cylon, Com. Adama said to his son that if it  
were his son that was lost, that he'd never stop searching. That family  
was most important. Why, then, in the last episode, is Com. Adama quick  
to leave his son, knowing that Roslin was only going to be around for  
a short while, and that both would now be alone.

​6) In Pegasus, why is Baltar's angel surprised at seeing a beat-up   
number 6? Why does she say "it's me", when it really isn't?

​7) if ressurection ships are so important, why not guard them better?  
why not have 2 ressurection hubs? why not a more distributed system?

​8) how far away really is the Cylon homeworld?

​9) in E16 2nd season, Sacrifice, we have people who claim the fleet are
  
cylon sympathizers and hold hostages. Not 2 episodes before, it was all  
about cylon sympathizer groups trying to force gallactica to try to get  
peace with the cylons. Each lasts 1 episode, and no more. so much  
of this would have been better with a plan, built up over several   
episodes.

​10) at the beginning of each episode they have a 1-minute "what has   
gone before", and then after the credits they have a 30-second flash  
of images from the episode. it is as if they don't trust the extended  
storyline structure, and they feel that a gimic is needed to entise   
viewers to stay.

​11) in Season 3 episode 8, Bulldog returns in a cylon raider after   
being gone for 3 years. Doc Cottle does a quick DNA test to match it   
against his military record, and concludes he's not a cylon. Wow! They  
couldn't do that in Season 1? It certainly would have made a huge   
difference. As plot holes go, that one is pretty darn big.

​12) I find it mindboggling that a race that has mastered organic   
technology cannot  
a) do a proper quarrantine  
b) diagnose a simple virus, that Doc Cottle can in a short while

​13) why do the cylons want a new home? why Earth?

​14) the incessant use of flashbacks I think is because there isn't a   
plan, and this makes it look like there is a consistent backstory

​15) the episodes with the coup, ending in the execution of Zarek and  
Gaeta...some of the best that the show has had. I'd say, that the best  
episodes have been:

Miniseries  
Pegasus - Resurrection  
New Caprica rescue  
Coup (S4ep 13-14)

Notice that these are all the human stories. the cylon stories are not  
nearly as good.

​16) Episode 15, when Tyrol tells Adama that the ship is slowly breaking
  
up, and there is cylon tech that can help suddenly Adama is anti-cylon  
tech? he changes his mind later, but still, this is inconsistent with  
the previous episodes when he was immediately fine upgrading jump
drives.   
why the sudden change of heart?

​17) when the BG makes it's final jump, Adama says: "whereever we are,
that's where we're going to stay"

...of course, until the rest of the fleet gets there, and we continue
with the   
original plan. Why did Adama say this?

​18) don't build a city at the end? don't use the technology? that   
seems like an idea from an idealist but not very practical - a sure way  
to reduce life expectancy in your new home

​19) Adama is a cylon. Kara is the harbinger of death. Baltar and Six
will be the mother  
and father of the human race. prophecies that don't pan out.

​20) from someone else, but exactly what I was thinking:  
"""  
When the season 1 [of Babylon 5] was aired JMS knew why Babylon 4 had   
appeared and what  
meant the visions saw there... when the first Shadow cruiser appeared   
in season 1 he fully knew what it was and who was behind it.. when in   
season 1 they talked about why Sinclair was so important and what   
secret he had..

All was shorted out in advance.. he even writed "scape doors" in case   
some actor stepped out of the series.. like happened with Michael   
O'Haire (Sinclair) left at the end of season 1.. he used a scape   
door introducing Sheridan..JMS has said he had scape doors for Delen,   
Garibaldi, etc..

You think BSG writers knew there was going to be 2 earths?   
Or who the remaining 8 models were going to be? Or even that Tigh   
and Tyrol were Cylons?... you think they really knew  
what the Opera house visions really meant? Or what the plan was?  
"""

​21) It seems to me that there would be a fool-proof way of killing a
cylon   
without it able to download: instantly drop it in the engine. unless the
  
download is able to be done in nanoseconds, there wouldn't be anything
left   
to download from.
