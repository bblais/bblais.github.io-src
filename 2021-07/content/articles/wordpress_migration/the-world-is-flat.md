Title: The world is flat!

So, I was listening to a Cosmos episode when [Carl Sagan described the
method that Eratosthenes][] used to calculate the circumference of the
Earth. He stated that, on a flat Earth, with the light from a far-away
object like the Sun all shadows would be the same length. Seeing
different-length shadows, as Eratosthenes did in his famous Summer
Solstice observation, allows you to infer curvature. But the big
assumption here is that the light is coming from very far away. If we
had a flat Earth, it is easy to set up a situation where the Sun,
directly overhead in some place, casts a 7 degree angle 800 km away as
Eratosthenes observed.

This simple arrangement results in a distance to the Sun of about 6500
km. The world is flat!

So, we have two different explanations of the observations. How do we
distinguish between them? Answer: the way it is always done in science -
spin out the consequences of each, and make predictions where they
disagree.

It is easy to show that continuing this calculation would result in some
striking predictions. First, given this distance, and the fact that
shadows change over the day, the apparent size of the Sun would be very
different from one location and another...and it is never observed to be
different, even across years. This suggests a very distant Sun. Further,
youâ€™d have to make sure that the Moon was closer than the Sun (inferred
from eclipses) in both models. Once you do this, then you have *two*
objects with the apparent size problem in the flat-Earth model, again
not supported by observation. There are probably many other predictions
this model makes which could easily have been verified by the ancients,
so it is no surprise that they did not consider it in their
calculations.

It is useful, however, to think about the consequences of models beyond
the data they agree with.
