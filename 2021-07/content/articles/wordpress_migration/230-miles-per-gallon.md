So [this story][] today about the new GM Volt to come out that
supposedly gets 230 mpg. My first thought when reading it is that they
are touting it as fossil fuel saver, and I'm skeptical. Essentially you
are replacing one fossil fuel with another (whatever the electric
company uses versus gasoline). There is no guarantee that the electric
company will use less fossil fuel than you would use, say, per mile of
driving. And there is no guarantee that the electric company will use
\*cleaner\* fuel than gasoline. Plus, batteries tend to be notoriously
difficult to dispose of, and are an environmental hazard themselves when
thrown out.

One advantage to replacing mobile power (e.g. gasoline) with stationary
power (e.g. electric company) is that one can replace the stationary
power with nuclear, which you just can't do with cars.

It is claimed that it will be cheaper for end users, "In Detroit, where
off-peak electricity rates are 5 cents a kilowatt hours, it will cost
about 40 cents to recharge batteries overnight." One does have to factor
in the maintenance costs, battery replacement, and battery disposal
costs into the cost of owning this new car.

Now, I am not against this development, as such, but it is important (as
always) to be aware of both the benefits and the costs of the new
technology. It is far too easy to read one side of the equation, pat
oneself on the back, while ignoring the hidden costs.
