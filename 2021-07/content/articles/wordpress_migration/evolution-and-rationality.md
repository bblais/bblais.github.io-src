[Stephen Law vs Alvin Plantinga on the Unbelievable podcast][] on the
topic of the "The Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism".

Basic argument, from [Wikipedia on Evolutionary argument against
naturalism][]

I haven't read the responses, so that my response will be fresh and
untainted.

There are certainly several things in this argument that need to be
thought out. Point (1) is certainly true: any beliefs that do not affect
behavior *in any way* would be invisible to evolution. I doubt there are
many beliefs in this category. Even something vague, like the belief in
a deist god, would at some point affect behavior in some way. Point (3)
is also uncontroversial. Point (2) I'm not sure I understand entirely,
so I'll focus on point (4).

There are two parts - "behaviour is caused by both belief and desire,"
and "innumerable belief-desire pairs could account for a given
behaviour" with the example of running from tigers because of various
false beliefs. The final piece of this, however, is the limited
resources of the brain. Our brain takes many computational short-cuts,
because of efficiency and limited resources. If you have a number of
different belief/desire pairs that lead to behavior, the brain will
settle on those belief/desire pairs that generalize to the largest
number of things. This will certainly be in cases where the result is
closer to reality than not. We run away not only from tigers, but also
bears, snakes, and spiders. The desire to pet or the mistaken belief
that running away is the best way to get towards an animal would not
generalize quite so well to these other creatures.

Plantinga uses this argument from rationality to bolster his theism - if
rationality is unlikely given naturalism and evolution, then theism is
more likely. However, he fails to notice that rationality isn't truly
the norm. Yes, we can make some astounding feats of rationality as a
collection, but it takes serious work to overcome the natural biases,
and failures of reasoning inherent in the human condition. The cognitive
short-cuts leads us to make many errors of observation, deduction, and
induction. He also fails to point out the many beliefs that people have
that are irrational but have a benefit, or the beliefs that people have
which are irrational and have no effect and thus can get carried along
without being selected against. In fact, the situation is very much like
what you'd expect from evolution - some wrong beliefs with adaptive
benefits, some wrong beliefs with no penalty, some correct beliefs by
accident, etc… Finally, even if our beliefs were 90% wrong, we'd still
be able to trust rationality *as a collection* - which is exactly what
science does. It forces fallible people to not believe things until it
can be replicated, it downplays anecdotal evidence, arguments from
authority, and recognizes the cognitive failures of humans in order to
overcome them.
