When I see things like this, I recall pieces of apologetics like
"everything that begins to exist has a cause", and "the existence of the
multiverse is a bigger faith claim than the existence of God", and they
ring empty to me...even if these particular scenarios don't pan out,
that they exist at all is a testament to science over religion...
