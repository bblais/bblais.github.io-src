Title: Science and Attitudes Toward Criticism

So this morning I got a strong criticism of my post, [“The Not-so-Hidden
Flaw in this Climate Argument”][], which itself is a criticism of
someone else’s criticism of a climate model (got all that?). I only had
a very brief moment to look at the comment, but it put me in a good
mood...a mood that I don’t think would be held by a similar-type
criticism in a non-science arena. I think there is a very big difference
between the way a scientist, through training, perceives and handles
criticism which was exemplified with my mood this morning. Let me try to
explain.

1.  It is a very good day for a scientist to go in to work, and to
    demonstrate that one of his colleagues is wrong. It’s even better if
    the wrong idea/theory/model is one that is popular! For those
    scientists to adequately demonstrate that a popular idea is wrong,
    we have for them the Nobel Prize. Of course, it is very hard to
    demonstrate that a well-established idea is wrong because, by
    definition, a well-established idea in science is one where many
    many smart people have tried to show it is wrong and have failed.
    For those people who claim that scientists have a conspiracy to
    uphold popular scientific ideas (a criticism creationists level
    against the support of evolution), they completely miss the goals of
    every scientist.
2.  It is also a good day when someone criticizes your idea. In the
    comment on my post, the criticism took the form of “if your idea is
    correct, how do you explain the following observation...”. Awesome!
    Why? First, someone bothered to read my post, and found it
    important/interesting enough to comment...that always makes me
    happy. Secondly, I’m now in a win-win situation. There are 3
    possibilities:
    -   the criticism is flat out wrong, and I get a chance to both
        teach something, and to bolster my idea...I can be a bit more
        confident in my idea.
    -   the criticism is partly correct, and I get a chance to add a bit
        of nuance, or explore a part of my idea that I hadn’t fully
        considered
    -   the criticism is correct, and I have learned something about the
        world and have to modify my thinking (at the expense of
        scrapping my idea).

Each of these 3 possibilities is wonderful, and it put me in a good
mood! In contrast, most people when criticized (think politics, sports,
religion, etc...) get defensive. They don’t look forward to the
possibility that they might be wrong, and may need to modify their
thinking. I prefer the scientific perspective!

Now I need to go and address the criticism.
