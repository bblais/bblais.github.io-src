I finished Leonard Mlodinow's "The Drunkard's Walk: How Randomness Rules
Our Lives" this past week, and have a couple of thoughts related to it.

<p>
In Chapter 10 he quotes Laplace:  

> "We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its
> past and the cause of its future. An intellect which at a certain
> moment would know all forces that set nature in motion, and all
> positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect
> were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would
> embrace in a single formula the movements of the greatest bodies of
> the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect
> nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be
> present before its eyes."
> </p>

<p>
and Mlodinow states that this is an expression of determinism. He then
further states   

> But for Laplace's dream to hold true, several conditions must be met.
> First, the laws of nature must dictate a definite future, and we must
> know those laws. Second, we must have access to data that completely
> describe the system of interest, allowing no unforeseen influences.
> Finally, we must have sufficient intelligence or computing power to be
> able to decide what, given the data about the present, the laws say
> the future will hold.
> </p>

He then criticizes it with the following three problems:

1.  society is not governed (as far as we know) by definite and
    fundamental laws in the way physics is
2.  like Lorenz, we cannot obtain the precise data necessary for making
    predictions
3.  human affairs are so complex that it is doubtful we'd be able to
    make the calculations anyway

He concludes "as a result, determinism is a poor model for the human
experience." His point seems to be, in some ways, obvious and in other
ways irrelevant.

Laplace was simply saying that "God" would not find anything random,
because of complete knowledge. The connection between knowledge and
inference, which probability theory affords, was worked out by Laplace
in great detail and it known to use today as Bayesian inference. The
structure of Bayesian inference describes randomness simply as the
product of our ignorance of the model, the parameters, the initial
conditions, the measurement details, etc... Laplace was simply saying
that with perfect knowledge, there is no randomness. E.T. Jaynes would
describe the "random process" as a mind-projection fallacy: you have
ignorance of the system, so you attribute its unpredictable behavior as
a product of the system itself. A rolled die is following Newton's Laws,
deterministically, and detailed knowledge of the die and the roll and
the surface should allow you to predict 100% of the time what it will
do. We lack that knowledge, thus the behavior becomes unpredictable. We
often then attribute that unpredictable behavior as a "random die", as
if it were the die that contains the randomness and not our own
ignorance.

Bringing in Lorenz, and chaos theory, is irrelevant here. Lorenz's
systems were completely deterministic, and it is theoretically possible
for a being to know the state of the system out to a sufficient number
of decimal places to provide any particularly set level of uncertainty
in the system. With the quantization of states, it then becomes possible
to know \*exactly\* what state something is in. Of course, quantum
mechanics is a two-edged sword in this example: it solves the chaos
problem, but adds an inherent, physical, randomness to the system which
is very peculiar.

The problem with Mlodinow, it seems, is that he hold human activity to
be a bit too special. We are, after all, made up of atoms and would thus
be governed by the laws of physics. Certainly it would be too complex to
handle, for us, but Laplace was not talking about us in his quote, or at
least not us right now or in the near future.
