Title: There is no population

So I've been following and intro stats class for a project of mine, and
came across this curious definition:

-   A statistic is number that describes a sample
-   A parameter is number that describes a population

I got to wondering what a population really is, and couldn't find the
dividing line between the sample and the population.  If you polled
everyone in a state, would that data represent population data or sample
data?  It becomes clear that the population is a theoretical concept
only, made-up to make a sampling distribution make sense.

More and more I find the Bayesian perspective demonstrably clearer. 
Sure, a statistic is a property of a sample of data.  A parameter is
always, however, a property of the model.  There is never a dividing
line here, and the limits of inference come down to the limits of the
model, and the limits of the data in constraining the parameters of the
model.  There is no population.
