I am not really into sports, but a student of mine is doing a project on
developing an automated system for predicting professional tennis
matches. We are posting his system's predictions for the [Australian
Open][]. I'll post more, before each round as the results come in. I
just want the predictions to come before the events! (I'm a bit late for
that, but I did receive the file two days ago. :) ). How well does it
do? You'll have to stay tuned!
