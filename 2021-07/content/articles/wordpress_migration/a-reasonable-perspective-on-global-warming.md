Title: A Reasonable Perspective on Global Warming

I’ve read a lot about global warming, taught issues about climate in my
classes, and have a decent (but not expert) understanding of the physics
involved. Among my colleagues I’m the only one who even entertains the
notion that the problem may not be as serious as the media suggests, and
I’m the only one who criticizes the IPCC and the “hide the decline” and
the extinct polar bears claims.

So it was refreshing to hear [this talk][] by [Prof Richard Muller][] at
Berkeley, and to see the [Berkeley Earth Project][] start up. It’s seems
to be a reasonable look at what we know confidently, what we really
don’t know, and many of the communications failures in the recent years
between the climate experts and the public. I was pointed to this talk
by [Dr Judith Curry’s website][], which also seems to be a breath of
fresh air on this whole topic. It seems serious and scientific. It
doesn’t resort to the hysteria of Al Gore or of Sarah Palin.

I’m looking forward to following these groups more closely in the
future.
