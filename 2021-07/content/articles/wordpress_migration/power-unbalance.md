I love watching infomercials, but always wonder how much the sellers are
exaggerating.  Take this infomercial for the "Power Balance" bracelet,
which is claimed to increase balance and coordination:

Now, go to this link which shows you how it **actually** works:

Make sure to watch the whole thing, because they give away the "trick"
near the middle.  It is useful to go back afterward and watch the first
one, now that you know the trick.

The real question, then, is: what should you do if you know a friend is
considering buying this, or worse, has already bought it?  When I showed
these videos in my class, I was told that the football team had
purchased them already.  When some of my students presented them with
the evidence, their response was that they didn't care whether it worked
or not.

Astounding!
