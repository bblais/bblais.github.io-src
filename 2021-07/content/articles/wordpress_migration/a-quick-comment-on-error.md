I read [this article][] in the Week magazine, concerning the upcoming
census. I plan to look at statistical sampling later, but I was struck
by the following:

The notion that a national count is completely error free is ridiculous.
I think everyone would agree that if you do a count, that you will not
get everyone. It is known that mistakes are made, omissions occur, and
that some people actively avoid the census. Because the census avoidance
is not random, the omissions are biased in some way. One can argue in
which ways the bias points, but the bias is there.

So what is the best plan of action in this case? You want to make an
estimate of the number of people in the country. "Estimate" is the
correct word, even for an enumeration, given the fact that the
enumeration is known to be incomplete. The best thing to do, then, is to
have a public and open statistical model of the process of sampling,
with independent ways to confirm the validity of the model. If the model
is simple, and open, it would be difficult to argue against. Without
this approach, a "strict enumeration" is really an unstated statistical
model where the assumptions are very difficult to see.
