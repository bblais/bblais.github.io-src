It was 20 years ago when I made the conscious decision to be an atheist.
I had been agnostic before, and then made a decision that it was no
longer a tenable position to hold, and that the atheist label was the
one that matched my mindset best. Since I became an atheist 20 years
ago, I never once regretted the decision. There hasn’t been anything at
all that has moved me from that perspective, until this week.

I’ve seen the light, and I’ve realized that in some ways it was the
wrong decision to become an atheist. I think it was what I needed at the
time, and now it is not. I even changed my Facebook profile!

So, what changed my mind? Sam Harris did, in his [lecture on the
“Problem with Atheism”.][] Essentially, it boils down to the fact that
we don’t need a word for not believing in something, and that to attach
a charged word to it undermines the position. We don’t need, as he says,
a name for “non-astrologer”. We just need to espouse the positive
virtues of believing with sufficient evidence, for the quantification of
uncertainty, of intellectual honesty and consistency.

So, in an effort to be more positive about my beliefs in evidence,
rationality, and science, from now on I am not going to consider myself
an atheist. If someone asks me if I believe in God, I will say I don’t
believe in Zeus, Thor or Yahweh (or any of the other gods we’ve heaped
on that pile we call mythology). If asked what religion I am, I’ll just
say “None”.
