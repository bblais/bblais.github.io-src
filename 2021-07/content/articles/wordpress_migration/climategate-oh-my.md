Title: Climategate, oh my!

I've been reading a lot about [Climategate][], and have a few comments
now, and hopefully more to come. What sparked this current thread of
thinking for me was [this post][] over in the [Statistical Modeling
blog][]. He summarized the physicists perspective on the "settled
science" in a nice way:

I would love to go point by point in this quote and show the
calculations, and I'd imagine that it would get stymied once I tried to
put in the water vapor feedback. I need to read more about this, because
from what I've read we **don't** understand the magnitude, or sign, of
the cloud feedback and that it could **easily** wipe out any warming
caused by CO~2~ increases.

Some of the comments are very good too, like:

The blog he refers to, [climateaudit.org][], is very interesting and is
exactly the way the commenter says: they are all for open information.
They post the data, the code, everything right up front and simply ask
everyone else to do the same. Why this isn't required for all scientific
publications, I don't know. Why it is not required for all high-stakes
publications (ones that could result in very high-stakes policy) I don't
know either. It's a travesty.

If everyone were as open about the data and the code, Climategate
couldn't have happened.

One final comment on this thread:

This is my point too: if it was warmer 1000 years ago, then the
hysterical language of the global warming media is completely
unjustified.

A *must read* is the [article by David Holland][],   
which outlines the problems with the hockey-stick analysis. He explains
the divergence problem, and the   
history of all this far better than I can summarize here.
