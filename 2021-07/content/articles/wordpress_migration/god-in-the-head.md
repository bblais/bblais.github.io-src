Which I thought was very well put.  If you think of it as two
hypotheses, H1="God is real" [I know that this isn't just one
hypothesis, because of the lack of definition...just to simplify], and
H2="God is in the head", it is interesting to think of the explanatory
power and the predictive power of the two hypotheses.

I would add that H2 also easily explains the *types* of miracles.  We
don't get amputees growing back limbs, but we do get things that can be
influenced by placebo and those that can get better on their own.  It
would be interesting to think of other things on each side of this
analysis.  Of course, one would probably have to have H1a, H1b, etc...
to be specific.
