In the face of Obama's new healthcare initiative, which [includes
provisions to cap the increases in insurance costs][], you can [read
here a nice description of the problems of fixing maximum prices][].
When the Government caps prices to help people, it is a policy which
goes in the category of "really simple, intuitive, well-intentioned, and
wrong."

More people need to understand the proper functioning of the free
market. This is true of people on "Main Street" as well as those on Wall
Street. I think I may be becoming more Libertarian in my old age. :)
