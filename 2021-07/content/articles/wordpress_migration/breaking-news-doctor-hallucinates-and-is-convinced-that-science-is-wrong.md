This [article in Newsweek][] about a neurosurgeon named Eben Alexander
who had a near-death experience, states that he is convinced that heaven
actually exists, and that science is wrong about the origin of
consciousness and what happens after death.  His argument:  "But as far
as I know, no one before me has ever traveled to this dimension (a)
while their cortex was completely shut down, and (b) while their body
was under minute medical observation, as mine was for the full seven
days of my coma."

Nowhere, however, does he seem to consider that, perhaps, his
hallucination could have happened in the brief interval of the cortex
shutting down or the interval of him waking up.  Even if he
*experienced* days away in paradise doesn't mean that the actual
experience lasted at all during the time that his cortex was confirmed
to be inactive.  Since this possibility took me a whole 10 seconds to
think of (and there could be others) it is clear he is not being
critical about, what is most likely, a very moving experience for him.
 I do not begrudge him this experience, and would love to have one
myself (if it didn't involved the significant risk of actually dying in
the process), but I would be loathe to make universal metaphysical
claims from this experience.  

A [nice response][] to this, as always, comes from Sam Harris.  Here Sam
Harris says:

> Alexander asserts that the cessation of cortical activity was “clear
> from the severity and duration of my meningitis, and from the global
> cortical involvement documented by CT scans and neurological
> examinations....The problem, however, is that “CT scans and
> neurological examinations” can’t determine neuronal inactivity—in the
> cortex or anywhere else. And Alexander makes no reference to
> functional data that might have been acquired by fMRI, PET, or EEG—nor
> does he seem to realize that only this sort of evidence could support
> his case....whatever structural damage appeared on CT could not have
> been “global.”...Coma is not associated with the complete cessation of
> cortical activity, in any case. And to my knowledge, almost no one
> thinks that consciousness is purely a matter of cortical activity. 

That about sums it up!
