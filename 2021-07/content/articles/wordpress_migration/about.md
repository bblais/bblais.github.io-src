Slug: about

I am a professor of Science and Technology at Bryant University in
Smithfield, RI, and a research professor in the Institute for Brain and
Neural Systems, Brown University. My research is in computational
neuroscience and statistics. I teach physics, meteorology, astonomy,
theoretical neuroscience, systems dynamics, artificial intelligence and
robotics. My book, ["Theory of Cortical Plasticity" (World Scientific,
2004)][], details a theory of learning and memory in the cortex, and
presents the consequences and predictions of the theory. I am an avid
enthusiast of [Python (the programming language)][] , a [Bayesian][] (a
la [E. T. Jaynes][]), and love music.
