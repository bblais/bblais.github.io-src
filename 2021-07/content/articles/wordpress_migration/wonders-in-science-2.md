Title: Wonders in Science

There is a tendency for scientists to be killjoys, raining on everyone
parade, poo-pooing cherished beliefs and activities from acupuncture,
religion, ufo’s, and homeopathy. Where is the wonder, the joy? I’ve had
someone, after a particular session debunking UFO shows on the history
channel, say “But wouldn’t it be great if they were true?” Yes! But I
don’t want to give up intellectual honesty for wishful thinking. If it’s
true, that’s great, but I won’t reduce my efforts to debunk it just
because I’d love it to be true. In fact, wanting it to be true motivates
me even more to be skeptical, knowing that I’ll be less critical of
something I want to be true (as most humans are).

Here’s at least one piece of wonder in the Universe. See the Earth in
this picture?

This is a picture of Saturn, with the Sun behind it, taken from the
Cassini spacecraft. See that little white speck in the rings, in the
upper left? That’s the Earth! There are two responses I have when seeing
this picture.

​1) We’re really small and insignificant in this Universe  
2) What an amazing thing that we can create something on the Earth, send
it a billion miles, and be able to take a picture of ourselves. That’s
amazing!

The universe is amazing, both in its magnitude and complexity, and we
should feel a sense of awe. All this, without introducing unnecessary
constructs such as deities. Although science is often accused of
arrogance, I can think of no humbler activity than that which brought us
the picture above.
