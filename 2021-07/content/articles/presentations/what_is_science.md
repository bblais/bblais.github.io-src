Today I gave [a presentation on the general topic of "What is Science?"]  After some brief remarks about what science isn't and some of the factors (such as attitude) which reflects the best of science, I had the audience of around 16 students perform tests on automatic flushing toilets.  The exercise, which I [published before], is a great way of getting at all of the concepts of experimental verification without any specialize equipment or preparation - the perfect platform for an informal talk or class. 

I then tried to show some things that we are confident work (and why) and things that we are confident *don't* work (and why) and finally some things where the picture is a bit fuzzier.  I'd prefer to have at least one more example of something non-trivial that we are confident works, for which the data is accessible. I use vaccines as an example, given its rising popularity and relevance in the news, but I'd love to have another.
