The moment we've been all waiting for, Statistical Heresies the movie is out!  You can watch it in a couple of places:

* [Bryant University Media Site] - a convenient way to see my slides, and me talking at the same time
* [YouTube]: You can hear me, but you might want to [download the pdf here](pdf/Statistical%20Heresies.pdf) to follow along.

The talk highlights some of the current Bayesian/frequentist relationships as they relate to introductory statistics education.  The discussion includes faculty from math, finance, environmental science, and others.

The abstract is:

> We live in a world where analytics in the form of statistical 
inference is playing a signiﬁcant role, from predicting 
elections, learning patterns in shopping habits, ﬁnding the 
genetic sources for diseases, and recognizing voice for 
computer control. Despite these successes, there is a serious 
disconnect between the best practices in the industry and 
what is typically taught at the undergraduate level. This 
faculty development seminar will introduce this problem, 
explore its history, present its causes, and make some modest 
proposals to solving it.
