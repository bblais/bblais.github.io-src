The cover art for my book, [Statistical Inference for Everyone], is something created by me and I'd like to explain my design.  We have a picture of [Saturn], taken by the [NASA Cassini Mission], with *moons* orbiting around replaced by dice.  This is a nod to [Laplace] who used the sorts of analysis presented in this book and applied it to calculating the mass of Saturn.  The point of the dice is to remind us that all of this analysis started in the determination of the chances of winning various games of gambling, and that all statistical inference derives from those basic principles.  We start by an analysis of dice rolling, and as a consequence can estimate the mass of Saturn and explore many other properties of the Universe.  Probability is everything!
