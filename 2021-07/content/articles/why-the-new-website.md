Title: Why the new website?

I completely changed the framework that I use for [my website], changing it from Rapidweaver (a mac-based, GUI website editor) to [pelican], a Python-based framework for making static websites.  Why did I do this?  There are many reasons.

* I liked the way that the website *becomes* a blog, so that updates to my research are more easily organized and documented
* I am a control freak with such things, and like complete configurability
* I like writing content in [Markdown], so that I can make small textual changes in the site without opening up a bloated editor
* Working in Markdown makes it easier to change frameworks/structure in the future

Let me know if things work, or don't!  I'd love to know if comments work, and if it is easy to follow updates via Atom, or perhaps RSS.  You can contact me at _bblais at gmail.com or bryant.edu_.

I'm still playing, so expect changes!
