Here are some notes about time management that I found useful from [this article](https://journal.thriveglobal.com/theres-more-than-enough-time-when-you-use-the-time-you-have-3ffa7adaa5d3): 

* If you're with your friends, be with your friends. If you're doing the dishes, do the dishes.
* **Good Things Are A Dime-A-Dozen**.  For me, passively watching a movie with my kids is good. However, actively engaging with them---whether playing games, laughing, playing out in the yard---is better.
*The problem with doing good things is that they are easy to justify, because they are inherently good. But, as Jim Collins, author of Good To Great, has said, "Good is the enemy of great. Few people attain great lives, in large part because it is just so easy to settle for a good life."
* **Always Take The Higher Road**
* When the alarm clock goes off , do you push snooze or get up? When you're with your spouse, do you compliment or criticize? Do you listen, or must you always speak?
* **Be Who You Ideally Want To Become, Today**
* As Bill Walsh has said, "Winners act like winners before they become winners." That's how they become "winners."
* Take time to write down your core values and goals.
