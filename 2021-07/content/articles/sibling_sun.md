subtitle: Long Lost Sibling of the Sun Found

On a "science is darn cool" note, the sibling of the Sun [has been found].  It's a pretty straightforward idea, although technically challenging.  Stars that are "born" from the same gas cloud will carry the same quantities of some rare elements, which can be used a a family signature.  It's a direct confirmation of a long-standing theory of stellar formation, and totally cool.  I'm reminded of a comment Richard Feynman made, which said that science adds to the appreciation of things that are available to everyone.  Looking up at the stars, the scientist doesn't just see points of light against a dark background, but sees pieces of a long story, of which we are all a part.
