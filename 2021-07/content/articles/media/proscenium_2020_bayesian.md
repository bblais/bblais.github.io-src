In this episode, Andrew and Matthew invite me back to talk about Bayes, what it is and how to apply it. We explore the structure of Bayes, when it can be used in non-quantitative applications, and why it is so important.  We cover the Monty Hall problem, the medical testing problem, the connection to Occam's Razor, and other topics.
