In this episode I join Andrew and Matthew to discuss The Fine Tuning Argument, The Second Law of Thermodynamics, contingency, evidence for the Christian claim of a historical resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, and other  topics found in Justin Brierley's book Unbelievable?: Why After Ten Years of Talking With Atheists, I'm Still a Christian. As you listen, you can decide for yourself whether Christian Apologetics draws appropriate conclusions from the best science of today. And, you will also have a meaningful guide if you read Justin's book.
