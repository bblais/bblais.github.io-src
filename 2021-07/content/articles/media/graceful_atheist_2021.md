In this episode, David (the [Graceful Atheist](https://gracefulatheist.com) and I explore how Bayes theorem can structure our thinking.  We bounce ideas off each other, talk about injecting information into arguments, and how the lack of imagination in exploring alternatives undermines the case for many apologist arguments.  We touch on decision theory and conspiracy theories, reiterating the fact that our beliefs have real-world consequences.
