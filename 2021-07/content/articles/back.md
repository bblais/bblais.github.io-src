title: End of a long semester
Date: 2015-12-21

So, I've been off the blog because of new job duties that overwhelmed me for a while.  I enjoy the new year as a way of starting again, clean slate, and to try to be better at what I like to do.  I'd like to write a lot more in the coming year so I'm trying something new. I'll post here if it works out (or not) somewhat later. 

Things on my to-do list for the winter "break":

1. Write a paper on the use of Wikipedia in the classroom
2. Finish and submit a paper on the dynamics of Twitter
3. Write some more about probability
4. Write a paper on the analysis of Michael Crichton's *State of Fear* for the classroom

If I can do even half of that, I'll call it a success!
