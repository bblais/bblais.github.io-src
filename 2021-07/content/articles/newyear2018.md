title: Happy New Year (again)!
date: 1/8/18
subtitle: A Time for New Beginnings (again)

As [I have written before](https://bblais.github.io/happy-new-year.html), I love the idea of New Year’s Day.  It’s a time for reflection, contemplation, self improvement.  I realize that it is technically just another day and just another year, and that one could definitely have any day in the year serve this role, but there still feels like something special for this day.

Back in 2016 I wrote:

> This year, I want to focus on writing.  My hope is to be able to write 300 words a day - that’s only a page of text.  But if I can do it every day, that’s a book! 

which didn't quite get done.  I did write more, but I couldn't keep the pace up consistently.  I plan to do a bit better this year, at least as an improvement.  My goal is to write on this blog 5 times a week.  Some may be pretty short, but I am motivated by the Art of Charm toolbox podcast episode [If Quality Is What You Want, Focus on Quantity (Episode 683)](https://theartofcharm.com/podcast-episodes/aoc-toolbox-quality-want-focus-quantity-episode-683/).  Go listen now!  

Let's see how this goes!
