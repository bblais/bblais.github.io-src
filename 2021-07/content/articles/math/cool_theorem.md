I was helping my daughter with geometry the other day and [this cute theorem popped up in the examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_bisector_theorem).  For some reason I don't recall ever seeing it before, and it struck me as somehow particularly elegant.  I have used (many times) the specific - [more limited version with isosceles triangles](http://ceemrr.com/Geometry1/RightTriangles/RightTriangles4.html) - but to see the generalization was just neat.

It makes me wonder also why I find enjoyment in something this simple and technical.
