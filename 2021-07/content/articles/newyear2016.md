title: Happy New Year!
date: 1/1/16
subtitle: A Time for New Beginnings

I love the idea of New Year’s Day.  It’s a time for reflection, contemplation, self improvement.  I realize that it is technically just another day, and that one could definitely have any day in the year serve this role, but there still feels like something special for this day.  I try to have some modest New Years resolutions.  Ones I have failed in the past are:

1. Lose weight
2. Do a triathlon

Ones that I have succeeded in the past are:

1. Lose weight
2. Read the entire Bible, cover to cover
3. Run a 5k
4. Run a half marathon
5. Read 6 books cover to cover (I have a bad habit of starting books and not finishing them)

This year, I want to focus on writing.  My hope is to be able to write 300 words a day - that’s only a page of text.  But if I can do it every day, that’s a book!  Mostly, I want to get the habit.  In the spirit of new things, I’m trying [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) as a new editing tool.  I’m not sure if it will work for me, but I do hope to get more blog writing and book writing this year.

This past semester got totally crazy, as I am to the chair of the department and thus have a lot of new responsibilities.  I am slowly getting used to it, but the end of the semester took all my writing time away.  Now, with a commitment to it, I do think that I can make progress on a number of projects that have been languishing somewhat - including this blog. 

On the plus side, this year I read *The Martian*, and saw the movie, both of which were fantastic.  Definitely a good science movie and book, highly recommended.
