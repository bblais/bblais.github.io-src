## Computational Projects

* [Statistical Inference for Everyone](../posts/2019/Jan/14/stats-for-everyone/)
> *Statistical Inference for Everyone* is an introductory textbook on statistical inference, motivated by probability theory as logic.  It is intended for a Statistics 101 audience.  

* [pyndamics3: Python Numerical Dynamics Simulator](https://bblais.github.io/pyndamics3/)
> * Pyndamics3 provides a way to describe a dynamical system in terms of the differential equations, or the stock-flow formalism. It is a wrapper around the Scipy odeint function, with further functionality for time plots, phase plots, and vector fields.

* [plasticity: synaptic modification in rate-based neurons](https://github.com/bblais/plasticity)
> Plasticity is a package with a convenient interface, used to run simulations of single cells and networks of neurons.

* [plasticnet + splikes:  synaptic modification in rate and spike-based neurons](https://github.com/bblais/Plasticnet)
> This project aims at providing a simple-to-use neural simulator at a medium-level of complexity. This package combines both rate and spike-based models.

* [Natural Images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0pJ77HPErGWM2xraE91SGF1RkE/edit?usp=sharing)
> This is a collection of natural images used in my research. It contains the original images, scripts for processing the images, as well as scripts to download some of the standard databases, such as the Olshausen and VanHateren image databases.

* [vacuum world](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1813623/Vacuum_World.zip)
> This is my first semi-serious project in Python. Python is an awesome language, and this project is to help teach python for an AI and Robotics class.

* [PyNXC](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1813623/pynxc.zip)
> Python to NXC converter.

* [plasticity (Matlab version)](http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/projects/plasticity/)
> Plasticity is a package of programs, with a convenient interface, used to run simulations of single cells and networks of neurons. It is used to explore BCM synaptic modification and Hebbian learning, amongst others.

* [$25 Thermal Cycler: A Programmable](http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/projects/cycler/)
> $25 Thermal Cycler is a very simple thermal cycler for performing PCR. The circuit itself costs a few dollars, and the control code can be easily run on a 486 running Linux. Go to the [Thermal Cycler page](http://web.bryant.edu/~bblais/projects/cycler/) to learn more about it.

* [Quantity.py](files/Quantity.py)
> A simple class for doing Monte Carlo error analysis

* [Classy](https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0&id=0B0pJ77HPErGWcjZlQ1lfTmltT28&export=download)
> A simple python-based classification system, implementing Naive Bayes, RBF clustering, and others.  Some [data files can be found here](https://docs.google.com/uc?authuser=0&id=0B0pJ77HPErGWSmR3OUwtcHU0QjA&export=download).
